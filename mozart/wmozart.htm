Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27<SUP>th</SUP> January 1756 - 5<SUP>th</SUP> December 1791),
 was born  in Salzburg. He was the son of Leopold Mozart (1719-87) a violinist and
 minor composer.
<P>
Mozart was very precocious, he played and composed by the age of 5, and was taken to
 the courts of Munich and Vienna in 1762 to appear with his gifted sister Maria Anna
 (1751-1829). Between 1763 and 1766 the familly toured Europe staying in London, Holland, Paris
 and Switzerland.
<P>
Mozart by now was composing symphonies and stage music. In 1767/68 he composed the German
 operetta <I>Bastien and Bastienne K50</I> and the Italian comic opera <I>La finta semplice K51</I>.
 In 1773, still only 17, he settled at the Salzburg court, where he wrote mainly church and entertainment
 music. Later in January 1775 he produced an opera <I>La finta giardiniera K196</I> in Munich with great
 success. At Salzburg he was not appreciated by the tyrannical archbishop, and decided to go
 on a long tour with his mother in 1777.
<P>
In August 1782  he married Constanze Weber, aged 19, who made him a thriftless wife but
 retained his love to the end.
<P>
The final period of his work had now begun. Mozart gave concerts for which he wrote
 superb concertos, started the set of string quartets dedicated to Haydn and produced a great
 variety of other works in rapid succession. In 1786 he produced the Italian opera <I>Le nozze di
 Figaro K492</I> in Vienna, followed by <I>Don Giovanni K527</I> in Prague, and in 1790 <I>Cosi
 fan tutte K588</I> in Vienna.
<P>
These masterpieces and his countless instrumental works did not make him prosperous. To make ends
 meet Mozart had to give poorly paid lessons and was so much in debt during his last years that he
 had to beg his friends for assistance.
<P>
In 1791 the production of <I>Die Zauberflote K620</I> was an immense success, but financially
 unrewarding. He was already ill when he received an anonymous order for the <I>Requiem K626</I>, which
 was left unfinished at his death on 5 December 1791.
