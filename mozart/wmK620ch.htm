<P>
Tamino, a young prince, is rescued from a gigantic serpent by three mysterious
ladies who invite him to rescue Pamina, the daughter of the Queen of the Night, from
Sarastro, whom they describe to him as a tyrant of monstrous cruelty.
<P>
Tamino, led to the temple by three Genii, discovers to his surprise that Sarastro
is the exact opposite of what he had been told. He decides to apply for initiation
into the mysteries of the priests, and in the second act he submits to various tests
of moral endurance. He meets Pamina for a moment at the end of Act 1, but he is not allowed
to speak to her until the final test of fire and water through which they pass
together to the blessed company of the initiates.
<P>
Pamina herself is also subjected to trials of a different kind, including the persecutions
of her mother, the Queen of Night, and a grotesquely revolting negro, Monostatos.
<P>
Tamino is accompanied throughout the opera by a comic figure, half man, half bird,
Papageno whose part in the play is that of a kind of Harlequin.
<P>End.
