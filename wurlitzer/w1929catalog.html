<H2>MILITARY BAND ORGANS for SKATING RINKS, CAROUSELLES, FAIRS and AMUSEMENT PARKS</H2>
<H4>by THE RUDOLPH WURLITZER MFG. CO.</h4>
NORTH TONAWANDA, N. Y.<BR>
Where Wurlitzer Band Organs are Built.</H4>
<H3><a name="1.0">1.0 Introduction</a></H3>
WURLITZER MILITARY BAND ORGANS
produce lively, enjoyable music of such great
volume that they are sure to attract crowds.
Built by Wurlitzer, who are renowned throughout the
world as the foremost manufacturers of musical instruments,
you are assured absolute dependability, and the
latest improved features. The variety of selections is
greater; the tone quality is superior, and the instrumentation
harmonizes and keeps perfect time.
Wurlitzer Military Band Organs will create and
maintain a splendid income. Many owners of Wurlitzer
organs have become independently wealthy. The saving
on music, and the increase in patronage should pay for
the instrument in a short time, and then yield a handsome
profit. You have no orchestra or band problems
to worry about. Just press a button, and the instrument
becomes your willing servant. You can start early,
please your crowd by playing longer numbers, and
instead of paying out most of your profit for music,
you can save it. A Wurlitzer Military Band never" gets
tired," and responds to your instant command.
Wurlitzer Music Rolls are cut correctly, and come in
all the latest popular and standard selections.
By using a paper roll system, we cut the music and
reproduce it exactly as originally arranged, giving it the
same snap and swing that the composer intended.

<IMG class="organ" SRC="w180-m.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=323 ALT="organ180">
<H4>2.13.1 Description</H4>
In introducing the Style 180 Organ, we have endeavored to produce
an instrument that will give satisfactory results in the way of automatic
band music for the largest skating rinks built.<br>
The case design is similar to the cut shown above. The front is finished in white
enamel, the hand-carved scroll-work decorated with colors and shaded bronzes.
The raised panels beautifully decorated with landscapes or flower designs. The
case is finished in light Golden Oak.<br>
The instrument has the Duplex Tracker Frame, which is driven separately by a
1/8 H.P. electric motor. This motor is operated by a remote control switch, so
that the music can be cut off at any time without shutting off the power on the
Blower line. This switch can be placed anywhere desired.<br>
It is impossible to build Bellows strong enough to supply the wind for an instrument
of this type. The suction and pressure is supplied by a specially constructed
steel Blower, driven by a 3 H.P. electric motor which operates at 3,500 R.P.M.<br>

<H3><a name="3.0">3.0 Special Features that are Exclusive to Wurlitzer Instruments</a></H3>
<H4>3.1 New Shaft Drive Transmission, No Belts</H4>
This Shaft Drive Transmission is just what you have been wanting on
your organ for years.
Taking the transmission used on our Duplex Tracker Frame as a
basis, we have developed a strongly built shaft transmission that we
are certain will completely eliminate all troubles with the driving of
the Tracker Frame.
On the Steel Crank Shaft we use a split steel gear which meshes
into a steel pinion on the upright shaft. These mesh perfectly and are
practically noiseless. At the top of the upright shaft we have a heavy
brass gear working into a pinion of the same material, making a
quiet transmission.
The coupling shaft is of cold rolled steel with a patent universal
coupling, made especially for this transmission, at each end, insuring
a steady even drive at all times.
<H4>3.2 New Pneumatic Rewind, No Levers to Adjust</H4>
Our improved Pneumatic Rewind and Drive device is a positive
rewind. It eliminates all the levers and adjustments formerly necessary
on the device used to shift the frictions from play to rewind
position.
<H4>3.3 Unit Valve Suction Windchest, Every Valve Accessible</H4>
On this new windchest each complete valve is built into an individual
unit block. Each unit valve block is held to the channel board
of the chest by two screws. Compression springs keep these screws
tight and the constant pressure takes up any shrinkage. To remove
the valve to clean or adjust it, simply loosen up the two screws. Be
sure to draw them tight again when replacing them. The motion of
each valve is adjusted to the thousandth of an inch, and should require
no readjustment.
<H4>3.4 Steel Crank Shaft, No More Breakdowns</H4>
Experience taught us that the cast-iron crank shaft could not be
depended upon. Rough handling in shipping often caused breakage,
completely disabling the organ. As a result, we have substituted the
steel crank shaft. This is a much more expensive shaft, but it gives
service.
<H4>3.5 Metal Tracker Bar Tubing</H4>
We are now using tin composition metal tubing, from the tracker
bar to the tube strip on the windchest. This tubing will last for years,
and removes any possibility of trouble with the tracker bar tubing.
<H4>3.6 Removeable Pressure Bellows, Easily Repaired</H4>
Our organs are so constructed that the main or Pressure Bellows
can be removed in a few moments' time, if in need of repairs. Loosen
the pump sticks, take out a screw here and there, remove the wedges
and slip the bellows out. No need to dismantle the whole organ.
<H4>3.7 New Snare Drum Action</H4>
In addition to the improvements mentioned in the previous paragraphs,
we have perfected a Snare Drum Action which operates entirely
from the suction. This action does away with the belts, pulleys
and cogs formerly used. It is a positive action, with much quicker
repetition and snappier action. To remove the Snare Drum from the
side of the organ, simply pull off the half-inch rubber tube and lift
off the bracket on which the drum is mounted.
<H4>3.8 Solid Bottoms</H4>
We are also equipping all our organs with a solid platform underneath.
This is a big improvement over the old construction. This
platform protects the bottom pipes of the organ when moving from
place to place, and helps to keep them dry.
Drums, equipped with the latest improved automatic spring tension
rods, which keep the drum heads always at the proper tension. This
feature alone is invaluable when the instruments are used for rink or
carouselle purposes where the drum heads are exposed to the constant
change of temperature.
<H4>3.9 Music Rolls</H4>
Our Long Tune Weather-Proof Music Rolls have revolutionized
Band Organ construction. Arranged by the best artists obtainable
and cut on specially treated weather-proof paper made especially
for this use, these rolls play an important part in demonstrating the
musical qualities of the Band Organ. No organ can give its best
service without the latest and best music. Not only must the music
be new but, the rolls must be strong and durable, made to stand long
usage and temperature changes.
Wurlitzer Long Tune Rolls meet these requirements completely.
