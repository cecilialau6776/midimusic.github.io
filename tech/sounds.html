<h3>The Story of Rich Olsen's Band Organ Sound Font</h3>
<h4>1.0 Introduction</h4>
<IMG id="olsen" SRC="R_Olsen.jpg" ALT="Rich Olsen">
Rich Olsen was a natural musician, he could listen to a tune and quickly
write an arrangement for any known organ scale. Having been a drummer
in various rock bands, his use of percussion in his arrangements
was immediately recognizable as being his.
<p>
Now, there are 22 Wurlitzer 165 rolls arranged by Rich, all produced in quantity and being
enjoyed on band organs public and private all over the country. He also arranged several rolls for Style 150 and Style 125 organs, along with
custom, MIDI-only work for individuals and arrangements for some other types of mechanical musical instruments as well.
<p>
The mechanical organ community suffered a great loss when he died. Rich was born on February 25, 1953 and succumbed
to an abdominal hemorrhage on October 22, 2013. He moved from San Diego, Calif., to Turlock to be closer to John and Gloria
Malone and their Play-Rite music roll operation in 2012, after suffering several health problems
<p>
Rich made and sold his musical arrangements mainly to Play-Rite Music Rolls in Turlock, Calif.
Play-Rite still make and sell music rolls for Wurlitzer organs. After he became famous he also made musical arrangements for
Matthew Caulfield, who knew most of the band organ owners, and sold them for him. Rich had a website at http://infamousstudios.tripod.com/
(now defunct) which he used to display some of his arrangements. Currently there are plenty of examples of Rich's arranging and his sound fonts
in Wurlitzer 165 rolls 6838 to 6854 on Matthew's website http://wurlitzer-rolls.com which are manufactured by Play-Rite.
<h4>2.0 The Sound Font Beginnings</h4>
Rich's goal was to create sounds from his Wurlitzer 165 data files so that his arrangements could be heard before committing them to punched
paper. The data format and 'audition' system was essentially defined by John Malone at Play-Rite Music Rolls. This system meant that Rich
had to play his music direct from tracker bar images. 
<p>
Malone decided how his Wurlitzer roll copying perforator would be modified for punching new music rolls from a computer file. An Octet
128-channel MIDI controller was installed to accept MIDI wireline data on Channel 1, notes 1 through 75, and the first 75 output signals
of the 128 were connected to magnet valves tee'd into the tracker bar hoses of the roll-copying perforator. 
<p>
Further, the ONLY change needed to punch other roll styles was to move the right side (treble) edge cutter to cut the width needed for
Style 165, 150 and 125 rolls. Malone was adament about that; he wanted the music roll image to scroll across the monitor screen and "onto
the paper". And he wasn't going to change cables or patch panels when changing roll widths.
<p>
John Malone had ordered a replica 165 organ from Johnny Verbeeck by this time, and Malone planned to equip the organ with magnet valves
and a controller card the same as on the perforator. Thus Rich could carry a laptop computer to the organ and plug in the MIDI cable to hear
the music, and if approved by Malone they would carry the laptop to the perforator in the shop and punch the 10-tune band organ roll.
<p>
In order to preview his music while composing it Rich colaborated with Robbie Rhodes
and tried to make a simulator program on the computer which would simulate the real Wurlitzer 165 organ when the MIDI cable was plugged in.
Robbie chose to use a separate, dedicated desktop computer to emulate the band organ, while Rich created an emulator that co-existed within
his single but powerful desktop computer. Both of them knew the big problem would be emulating the lock-and-cancel stop system and the swell
shutters. This simulator used the sound font described below and was used to make audition files which he sent to prospective customers.
<h4>3.0 Original Characteristics</h4>
<h4>3.1 Samples</h4>
The majority of sound samples are Mortier, recorded at the well-restored 98-key Mortier dance organ in Mike Ames' collection
in Solana Beach, California. The Mortier samples exhibit low distortion and relatively little interference from nearby reflections 
(primarily from within the organ case).
<h4>3.2 Instruments</h4>
Since Rich arranged music using a tracker bar image, the MIDI input to the synthesiser had to be a tracker bar image that 
begins at MIDI note 1 or thereabouts. Thus all the MIDI instruments had to be tracker bar images of the various organs which were
selected as the music played. This was done by inserting midi patch changes selected according to the stop and shutter settings required.
<h4>3.3 The operating environment</h4>
Somewhat coincidentally, when they met in late 2004 both Rich and Robbie were using computers running Windows 98, with sound output
from installed Creative Sound Blaster Live! audio cards.
<p>
Both had tried to use Windows XP but Creative and/or Microsoft wouldn't provide drivers for XP with
the features that were in Windows 98. That's why they continued running Windows 98 with the Sound Blaster Live! card. The specific 
sound card product was Creative CT4620.
<p>
Richie used Cakewalk Pro of 2000 or 2001, Robbie used Master Tracks Pro Audio of about the same era. Both MIDI editors have a
"piano roll" display which is appropriate for editing music rolls and tweaking the timing of percussion devices.
<h4>4.0 Developments</h4> 
By 2008 Rich considered that the layout of his soundfont was mature, and wouldn't be changed. But it would grow as further sound voices
were added and fidelity improved.
<p>
Early in 2009 Richie began working with the jOrgan simulation environment and he experimented using FluidSynth soundfont program
in lieu of the Sound Blaster card. An advantage of FluidSynth is it runs okay under Windows XP, too. So Richie gradually changed
over from running the soundfonts under Win 98 to running them under Win XP using FluidSynth.
<p>
After he became famous Rich branched out into contract arranging and developed some Marenghi sound fonts and maybe others.
<p>
Before his sudden death Rich achieved only partial success using jOrgan to play Wurlitzer 165 roll images while emulating the 
Wurlitzer lock-and-cancel control system, still by inserting patch change instructions in the MIDI file at the places where lock-
and-cancel instructions occurred.
<h4>5.0 My Adaptations</h4>
I knew that e-rolls already contained the necessary stop and shutter controls and had already
developed MIDI software to convert e-rolls to fully instrumented and activated playable files.
Also I had developed a midi player which could play these files on Windows systems, but this player
relied upon public domain GUS formatted General Midi instruments.
<p>
The result was that the software could play e-rolls but sounded awful because of fundamental
defects in the GUS sound font files and the poor quality of the instruments contained therein.
<p>
At this point I knew I needed some proper sound samples from a real organ so in late February 2015
I contacted the Mechanical Music Digest website with a request for someone who had a playable w165 to
record it playing my w165 test roll. Matthew Caulfield suggested I should contact
Robbie Rhodes to see whether Rich Olsen's Band Organ sound font could be made available. At that
time I had heard of Rich but knew nothing about him or the existence of his band organ
sound font. In fact I did not know that anyone apart from me was experimenting with the
direct playing of band organ e-rolls. The font was available and I was delighted to receive a copy.
<p>
The sound font I received in early 2015 was the 2008 version in .sf2 format which contained an excellent set
of band organ samples but the instruments and presets were all based
upon tracker bar images. I instantly decided that I could not work with these instruments and presets because
I wanted to directly play MIDI e-rolls without having to insert patch changes to cope with stops.
<p>
Thus my first task was to remove the tracker bar image presets and to convert the instruments
so that they played correctly when the standard midi note numbers were fed to them (instead
of tracker bar hole numbers). While doing this I noted several inexplicable peculiarities in the
sound font:
<ol>
<li>The w165 instruments in the font contained both soft and loud violins which were different in both tonal
quality and volume. Apparantly in Wurlitzer 165 organs the soft violins are identical to the loud ones
and nobody knows which of the two melody violin stops refers to the loud violins. I have retained
the two types of violin. Melody Violin 1 (tracker hole 9) is the Soft Violin and Melody Violin 2 (tracker hole 69)
is the Loud Violin.</li>
<p>
<li>The w150 instruments did not contain any Melody Open Flutes; these pipes are defined by Wurlitzer
for all versions of the 150. As his font contained Melody Open Flutes for Stinson Organs I have copied
these into my version of his font which I use for eplay150. Also the 150 has an automatic stop on the
melody open flutes but since Rich did not have any, he put the stop on the Accompaniment Violins
instead. I have changed this back to Melody Open Flutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>
 I then had to make major changes to my playing software so that it
could use .sf2 fonts instead of GUS fonts. At this point I experimented with several different players
to find the one that worked best with .sf2 fonts and had its source software available. Fluidsynth passed
all the tests and this is what I used. However it is far from perfect because it does not provide
any feedback of song position or allow pausing while playing.
<p>
The final results are music to my ears, breathtakingly good sound from first quality organ simulations.
<p>
<h4>5.0 Extensions</h4>
This work and the skills I have accumulated could be readily applied to directly play scanned
music rolls for other instruments from pianos (very easy) to residence organs (less easy but
still possible). The only requirement being that sufficient information is known or can be
found out about the instrument concerned, such as full tracker bar details and instrumentation data.
