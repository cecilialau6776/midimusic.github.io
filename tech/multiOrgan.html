<h2>MultiOrgan</h2>
<h4>Author: David Back, June 2016</h4>
<h3>MultiOrgan, Multiple Organ Midi Player</h3>
MultiOrgan is a midi player which can accept and play almost any
organ-like midi source. Input is via a standard midi port. A midi
source can be the output from almost any standard midi player e.g. "Midi Player"
or a specialised e-roll player such as my eplayWin32.
<p>
As supplied multiOrgan is set up to imitate a selection of
Estey, Miditzer, Wurlitzer and Hauptwerk organs. Any other organ can be added
and will play provided you have an appropriate sound font (.sf2 format) file.
sf2 is the most common and best standard sound font format. Many sound fonts
are provided and the others may be downloaded from the internet. You can even
make your own sound fonts, as I have. The screen keyboard allows you to
audition your sound font and stop settings using a mouse. Provision is made
for each manual to have its own sound font if necessary.
<p>

MultiOrgan is designed to be the "other end" of eplayWin32 which will
play all the Estey e-rolls available in my
<a href="../estey/archive/index.html"> Estey organ music archive.</a>
EplayWin32 version 3.0 will also play all the Wurlitzer Band Organ e-rolls in my
<a href="../wurlitzer/archive/index.html"> Wurlitzer Band Organ archive.</a>
<p>  
Output from eplayWin32 is sent to a midi port from whence it will connect
to multiOrgan via a real or virtual midi cable. MultiOrgan can be running
on the same computer as eplayWin32, or on any other computer.
<p>
MultiOrgan will also play midi files which have been produced by, or for,
other organs. Simply route the output from any standard midi file player
(I use "Midi Player" V3.6) to the input of multiOrgan and it can correctly play
these files.
<p>
EplayWin32 and MultiOrgan were produced using Windows 10 but will work on all versions
of Windows back to and including XP.
<p>
EplayWin32, multiOrgan and "Midi Player" will also work correctly under Wine when installed
on an iMac or most Linux systems. (Tested and OK on Ubuntu and Debian Linux)
<p>
<a href="multiOrganV1_0setup.zip"> multiOrganV1_0setup.zip</a> Download multiOrgan.<br>
Completely free to download and to use.
<p>
<a href="multiOrgan_ini.zip"> multiOrgan_ini.zip</a> The latest multiOrgan.ini
file contains updated stop mappings -- particularly, the mutation stops now work
correctly and some minor corrections improve performace. muiltiOrgan itself
has not been changed.
<p>
If you have already downloaded multiOrgan you need only download the update.
Otherwise, for new users, you need both downloads.
<p>
MultiOrgan can be played from any midified multi-manual organ console.<br>
Alternatively, manual inputs, pistons and couplers can be provided by multiPiston, below.
<p>
You can play at least six copies of multiOrgan simultaneously, if each copy
is located in its own folder then each one can be set up differently. This
will give the equivalent of a 24 manual organ with the possibility of 24 different
sound fonts. I cannot even begin to think of the endless musical possibilities
this gives to someone with an inventive mind.
<h3>MultiPiston, Pistons and Couplers for multiOrgan and most other organs</h3>
Multipiston provides midi inputs for 3 manuals, pedals and swell pedal.<br>
Programmable pistons are provided for each manual and pedals.<br>
A selection of couplers between the manuals and pedals are provided.<br>
A "Cancel" button cancels all pistons and couplers.<br>
The inputs, pistons and couplers are combined and fed to a single midi output which is
fed to the organ's input.<br>
<p>

Multipiston has negligable latency and will run on Windows or iMac under Wine.
<p>
Multipiston has been designed for use with a touch screen and will work with Hauptwerk,
Miditzer and multiOrgan organs. If you need more manuals or pistons you can run several
copies of multiPiston simultaneously.
<p>
Available soon (free to download and to use).
