<h2>EplayOrgan</h2>
<h4>Author: David Back, November, December 2017, March, June, July, October 2018<br></h4>
<h3>EplayOrgan, Multiple Pipe Organ Simulator</h3>
<h4> Version 2.2f Now Available for download</h4>
EplayOrgan is a multi purpose sample based pipe organ simulator intended to be playable by organists and
versatile enough to be useful to everybody with an interest in organs. It will load and be playable
almost instantly and does not need an expensive computer with huge amounts of memory.
<p>

This organ was designed and tested on a 64 bit Windows 10 system but was always intended
to be versatile in that it will run on any Windows system back to and including Windows XP.
It will also run on any Mac or Linux system under Wine. Latency is negligable under Windows.
<p>
I am still gaining experience with it myself and invite comments from others, particularly
experienced organists, on its merits or problems with playability. My contact details are
in <a href="../about/index.html"> About</a> on this website. I will endeavour to cure any problems
which arise and issue new versions as appropriate.
<p>

<p>
Pistons can be selected by program changes in a midi file, making this organ perfect for translating organ midi files to play
properly on other organs. See: <a href="./convert.html">Organ File Conversion</a> for details.

Second touch is now optionally available on all organs. Unlike other organs the second touch keys move to show exactly what is happening.

You could use velocity sensitive ranks to make the first velocity sensitive pipe organ.
