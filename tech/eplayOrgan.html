<h2>EplayOrgan</h2>
<h4>Author: David Back, November 2017<br></h4>
<h3>EplayOrgan, Multiple Organ Simulator</h3>
<h4> Version 1.0 Now Available for download</h4>
EplayOrgan is a brand new multi purpose organ intended to be playable by organists and versatile
enough to be useful to everybody with an interest in organs. It will load and be playable almost
instantly and does not need an expensive computer with huge amounts of memory.
<p>

This organ was designed and tested on a 64 bit Windows 10 system but was always intended
to be versatile in that it will run on any Windows system back to and including Windows XP.
It will also run on any Mac or Linux system under Wine. All the basics are in place for producing
native Mac and Linux versions in due course. Latency is negligable under Windows.
<p>
I am still gaining experience with it myself and invite comments from others, particularly
experienced organists, on its merits or problems with playability. My contact details are
in <a href="../about/index.html"> About</a> on this website. I will endeavour to cure any problems
which arise and issue new versions as appropriate.
