<h2>Organ file conversion</h2>

<h3>How to convert organ MIDI files to play on another organ</h3>
An organ midi file will play correctly only on the organ it was recorded on. This article describes a general method
to convert these files so they will play correctly on a different organ.
<h4>Conversion method<br>Using eplayOrgan and a midi editor</h4>
1. Use eplayOrgan to play the original file on its correct organ, pause at the beginning after the stops have been
selected and make a note of every stop selected for each division.
<p>
2. Continue playing and again pause when the stop selection changes and note the time and the new stops which have
been selected.
<p>
3. Continue to the end, pausing and noting the times and all of the stops which are selected. You will probably
see a pattern of sets of stops repeatedly selected. Later you will be programming these or similar stops into the
pistons of the target organ. Pistons will be selected using midi program changes which you edit into the midi file
at the points where the stop selection changes. 
<p>
4. Using the midi editor now begin editing a copy of the original file. Using the table below as an example alter the
midi channel of each division to that of the target organ. If the target organ has more divisions than the source it
will probably be better to convert swell to great and great to acc, omitting the target's swell.
<table class="joplin">
<tr><th COLSPAN=7>Organ Midi channel examples</th></tr>
<tr><th>Miditzer 160</th><th>Miditzer 216</th><th>Miditzer 260</th><th>HW St. Annes</th><th>HW Paramount 310</th><th>HW Burea Church</th><th>Viscount Regent</th></tr>
<tr><td>swell ch2</td><td>swell ch1</td><td>swell ch1</td><td>swell ch3</td><td>swell ch4</td><td>swell ch3</td><td>swell ch3</td></tr>
<tr><td>great ch1</td><td>great ch2</td><td>great ch4</td><td>great ch2</td><td>great ch3</td><td>great ch2</td><td>great ch2</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>acc ch2</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>acc ch2</td><td>acc ch4</td><td>acc ch4</td></tr>
<tr><td>pedal ch3</td><td>pedal ch3</td><td>pedal ch3</td><td>pedal ch1</td><td>pedal ch1</td><td>pedal ch1</td><td>pedal ch1</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
5. As an example, the original stop changes for Miditzers will be on ch 16. The locations of these changes will be all grouped
together at particular times. At each of these times mark the (swell,) great, acc and pedal with program change events beginning
at PC0 and working upwards PC1, PC2 etc. for each change of stops. Start each division with PC0. If there is a pattern
use the same PC for each occurance of the same stop selection. You only mark a division if the stop selection has changed
for that division. The pedal often uses the same selection all the way to the end so only needs to be marked at the beginning.
<p>
6. Delete all of the empty channels and delete all of the original stop settings.
<p>
7. Save the file and set up the target organ's pistons so that the program change events in the file will trigger the pistons
and set the correct stops for each program change. PC0 sets the PP piston, PC1 sets the P piston and so on.
<p>
8. Play the edited file on the target organ if you have set the pistons correctly it should play and sound more or less
like the original.
<p>
9. If it's OK record it, tickling the swell pedal at the start of the recording and pressing cancel at the end of the recording.
<p>
10. Name the file, including the organ type in the name. Play the recorded file -- if OK use the midi editor to edit in the title
and you are finished.
<p>
I will add some examples of converted midi files later.
<p>
<h4>Estey and Wurlitzer e-rolls<br>Using eplayWin32 and eplayOrgan</h4>
The hard work has already been done inside eplayWin32. So simply record the destination organ while it is playing the e-roll.
Don't forget to add Cancel at the end before stopping the recorder.
