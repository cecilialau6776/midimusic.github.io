<h2>Organ file conversion</h2>
<h3>By David Back, June 2018</h3>
<h3>How to convert organ MIDI files to play on another organ</h3>
An organ midi file, in general, will play correctly only on the organ it was recorded on. This article describes a
general method to convert these files so they will play correctly on a different organ.
<h4>Conversion method<br>Using eplayOrgan and a midi editor</h4>
1. Use eplayOrgan to play the original file on its correct organ, pause at the beginning after the stops have been
selected and make a note of every stop selected for each division.
<p>
2. Continue playing and again pause when the stop selection changes and note the time and the new stops which have
been selected.
<p>
3. Continue to the end, pausing and noting the times and all of the stops which are selected. You will probably
see a pattern of sets of stops repeatedly selected. Later you will be programming these or similar stops into the
pistons of the target organ. Pistons will be selected using midi program changes which you edit into the midi file
at the points where the stop selection changes. 
<p>
4. Using the midi editor now begin editing a copy of the original file. Using the table below as an example alter the
midi channel of each division to that of the target organ. If the target organ has more divisions than the source it
will probably be better to convert swell to great and great to acc, omitting the target's swell.
<table class="joplin">
<tr><th COLSPAN=9>Organ Midi channel examples</th></tr>
<tr><th>Miditzer 160</th><th>Miditzer 216</th><th>Miditzer 260</th><th>HW St. Annes</th><th>HW Paramount 310</th><th>HW Burea Church</th><th>Viscount Regent</th><th>Allen, Church</th><th>Allen Theatre</th></tr>
<tr><td>swell ch2</td><td>swell ch1</td><td>swell ch1</td><td>swell ch3</td><td>swell ch4</td><td>swell ch3</td><td>swell ch3</td><td>swell ch1</td><td>swell ch4</td></tr>
<tr><td>great ch1</td><td>great ch2</td><td>great ch4</td><td>great ch2</td><td>great ch3</td><td>great ch2</td><td>great ch2</td><td>great ch2</td><td>great ch1</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>acc ch2</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>acc ch2</td><td>acc ch4</td><td>acc ch4</td><td>acc ch4</td><td>acc ch2</td></tr>
<tr><td>pedal ch3</td><td>pedal ch3</td><td>pedal ch3</td><td>pedal ch1</td><td>pedal ch1</td><td>pedal ch1</td><td>pedal ch1</td><td>pedal ch3</td><td>pedal ch3</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
5. As an example, the original stop changes for Miditzers will be on ch 16. The locations of these changes will be all grouped
together at particular times. At each of these times mark the swell, great, acc and pedal channels with program change events
beginning at PC0 and working upwards PC1, PC2 etc. for each change of stops. Start each division with PC0. If there is a pattern
use the same PC for each occurance of the same stop selection. You only mark a division if the stop selection has changed
for that division. The pedal often uses the same selection all the way to the end so only needs to be marked at the beginning.
<p>
6. Delete all of the empty channels and delete all of the original stop settings.
<p>
7. Save the file and set up the target organ's pistons so that the program change events in the file will trigger the pistons
and set the correct stops for each program change. PC0 sets the PP piston, PC1 sets the P piston and so on.
<p>
8. Play the edited file on the target organ. If you have set the pistons correctly it should play and sound more or less
like the original.
<p>
9. If it's OK record it, tickling the swell pedal at the start of the recording and pressing cancel at the end of the recording.
<p>
10. Name the file, including the organ type in the name. Play the recorded file -- if OK use the midi editor to edit in the title
and you are finished.
<p>
<h4>Example: Converting Lichtensteiner Polka<br>from Miditzer 160 to Miditzer 260</h4>
The following table shows the original stops and the program changes which replace them. This was obtained by playing
the original file Lichtensteiner Polka-160.mid on eplayOrgan -- which conveniently can be paused when the stops change so
the new settings can be noted down.
<table class="joplin">
<tr><th COLSPAN=4>Piston 1 (PC0)</th></tr>
<tr><th>Pedal Ch3</th><th>Swell Ch2</th><th>Great Ch1</th></tr>
<tr><td>Bour 16</td><td>Bour 16</td><td>Trumpet 8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dia 8</td><td>Trumpet 8</td><td>Sal 8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sal 8</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Flute 8</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Piano 8</td></tr>
<tr><th COLSPAN=4>Piston 2 (PC1)</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Trumpet 8</td><td>Trumpet 8</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Flute 8</td><td>Sal 8</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Flute 4</td><td>Flute 8</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Flute 4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Piano 8</td></tr>
<tr><th COLSPAN=4>Piston 3 (PC2)</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Bour 16</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Trumpet 8</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Flute 8</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><th COLSPAN=4>Piston 4 (PC3)</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Trumpet 8</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Viol 8</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Flute 8</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Flute 4</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><th COLSPAN=4>Piston 5 (PC4)</th></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Bour 16</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Trumpet 8</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Flute 8</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Flute 4</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
A copy of the original file, Lichtensteiner Polka-piston.mid, has been edited to include the above program changes
inserted at the correct times in the correct channels. The original stop channel 16 and all of the stop settings
in it have been deleted. After doing this the channels have been changed to those required by the target organ,
the Miditzer 260. Note that the original Swell has been changed to Great and the original Great is now Acc.
<p>
This file will now be played on eplayOrgan set up to be a Miditzer 260. The pistons will be set up to reflect the original
stops as in the table above and the result recorded.
<p>
The final file is Lichtensteiner Polka260.mid which will play correctly on a Miditzer 260. For completion, edit in
to this file the name of the music and a General Cancel (for Miditzer 260, a telephone ring, PC124, on ch 16) at the
start of the file.
<p>
The piston file could just as well have been played on any other organ which has had its pistons set up as above.
Thus the original file could be converted to play correctly on any other organ. Try it out for yourself.

<h4>Estey and Wurlitzer e-rolls<br>Using eplayWin32 and eplayOrgan</h4>
The hard work has already been done inside eplayWin32. So simply record the destination organ while it is playing the e-roll.
Don't forget to add Cancel at the end before stopping the recorder.
<p>
<h4>Wurlitzer e-rolls<br>Using eplayWin32, eplayOrgan and a midi editor</h4>
You can also convert Wurlitzer Band Organ e-rolls to play on a normal organ. First record the e-roll playing on the correct
Band Organ then use the piston method above to convert the recording to play on another organ. There is a minor problem with swell
pedals -- Band organ shutters produce only one midi event whereas some organs have two swell pedals and need two midi events.
