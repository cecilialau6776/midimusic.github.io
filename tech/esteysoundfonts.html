<H2>How to play Estey Music Rolls</H2>
<H4>Compiled by: David Back September 2015. Updated October 2015.</H4>
<P>
This Document shows how to produce soundfonts for playing Estey Music Rolls. (It is as yet incomplete).
<p>
It is assumed herein that you have a knowledge of music and organs. For a basic source of music you
can download over 500 playable Estey Music Rolls from my <a href="../estey/archive/index.html">estey e-roll archive.</a>
You can also download my player eplayestey which can play these rolls. <a href="../tech/index.html">Wurlitzer and Estey e-roll Player.</a>

<h3>1.0 Requirements</h3>
In order to get an idea of what is required it is necessary first to consider the estey tracker bar
which is explained in <a href="estey-tracker.html">Estey Player Organ Tracker Bar Data.</a> This
includes general details of how the organs were instrumented. It is necessary to interpret this instrumentation
data because no Estey Player Organ ever produced used instruments with these exact names.
The most reliable information about instruments/pipes actually fitted is in the Estey "Shop Orders",
some of which are available on line.
<p>
You will see that the requirement for playing Estey Music Rolls is divided into Early Music and Stage 1 New Music
which begins at roll 404. Each type of roll appears to need a different soundfont. I say "appears to" because
many of the rolls produced after roll 404 do not use the extra capabilities of Stage 1 New Music. It is thus
debatable which soundfont should be used to play these rolls. I have chosen to continue using the Early
Music soundfont because most organ owners will not have updated their organs until much later (if ever).
<p>
It would make sense to make use of multiple banks in the font, however all my fonts use only Bank 0
because I was unable to make any other bank work reliably on the iMac. (This bug is probably due to "out
of order execution" which is sometimes a problem with multiple core processors and very difficult to
track down.)

<h3>4.0 Sound Font for Stage 2 New Music</h3>
Stage 2 New Music (Rolls 1100 and above) should require some additional Selected Combinations but as there is no known
information as to what these combinations should be I have chosen to use the Stage 1 Soundfont as above to play them.
Eplayestey also does not implement the extra pedal notes used by Stage 2 New Music, again no known information available.
However the soundfonts do contain these notes for future use.
<h3>5.0 Future Development</h3>
The Estey Soundfonts I have produced are based upon sound samples from Stefans Cathedral Pipe Organ font plus a few
from elsewhere. There are other public domain organ soundfonts available but Stefans is the best I have found for
use as a starting point. I do not think the Gamba is the right choice for 8' Strings as the Viol would be better.
However the Viol currently avaiable does not play high notes well. I am on the lookout for a better one.
<p>
My Estey Soundfonts suffer from "Out of Tune Harmonics" on some high notes, these are high harmonics of
already high notes. I am investigating.
<h3>6.0 Tuning</h3>
I have been through all of the instruments and checked the tuning of all notes. They are not perfect but are all
adequately in tune.
