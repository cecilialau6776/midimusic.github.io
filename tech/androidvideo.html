<H2>MidiMusic Android Video Apps</H2>
These video apps are digitally signed and will not bombard you with ads.<br>
They are free to download and free to use. The apps are designed to work with Android Version 3.0
or later.
<p>
In order to install these .apk's you need to get them into the Downloads directory of your Android phone or tablet.
You can either download direct by displaying this page on your phone or tablet or download
to a PC or Mac and then transfer the .apk file manually to your phone or tablet.
<p>
<h3>Scott Joplin</h3>
<p>
The MidiMusicVideo app will play videos of all of Scott Joplin's piano music. As the
video files are too large to incorporate into an app they have to be located on the internet.<br>
The app also needs to determine whether you are connected to wifi or to a 3g telephone network so it can restrict the bandwidth (and thus the cost) if you are connected to 3g.
<p>
Thus an internet connection is required in order for this app to work and the app requires permission
to connect to the internet and to detect a wifi or 3g connection.
<p>
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/255605719/tech/MidiMusicVideo.apk">MidiMusicVideo.apk</A> Securely download v1.2 here.
<p>
This is the third release of this app and it now displays in full screen and allows you to set
up your preferences for starting silently and or playing continuously.<p>
The inactive progress bar is incorporated into the downloaded video and as far as I know I cannot
get rid of it. Just touching the screen while a video is playing will bring up the active progress bar.<p>
The User Interface is displayed for 10 second between each video which allows optional adjustment
of the controls.
