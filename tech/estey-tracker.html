<h2>Estey Player Organ Tracker Bar Data</h2>
<h4>Author: David Back, May 2015.<br>Updated June, September, October and November 2015 and again September 2016.</h4>
This data was collected from various sources including an in depth study of scanned Estey music
rolls and information from Treasures of Mechanical Music by Reblitz and Bowers.
<h3>1.0 Rolls</h3>
Early organs: Non Registering Rolls (i.e. No Stop perforations in the roll) are 10.125" wide.<br>
All these rolls that I know about are prefixed with a "C" and have their stop selections printed on the roll so that
stops can be selected manually while the roll is playing.
<p>
Later organs: Self Registering Rolls (i.e. With Stop perforations in the roll) are 10.75" wide.<br>
A few early rolls of this width were prefixed with a "C". This indicated that the original roll had stop
selections printed on the roll so that the roll could be played either using the included stop selections
or with manual selections while the roll was playing.<br>
Note that these later organs had a "Stop Control" piston which could select whether the roll stops or manual stops were used.
<p>
Both type of roll have 12 holes per inch in 2 staggered rows.
<h3>2.0 Data</h3>
<h4>2.1 Notes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Odd tracker holes = top row (Swell Organ)</li>
<li>Even tracker holes = bottom row (Great Organ)</li>
<li> * Pedal notes are lowest octave of Great Organ</li>
<li> + 20 Chime notes are midi 57 to 76 on the Swell Organ when 5+ is selected. (Ref: Roll 990e.mes)
<li>Shades operate only on the Solo (Swell) Organ.</li>
</ol>
<h4>2.2 Initialisation</h4>
<ol>
<li>All stops and pistons are closed.</li>
<li>Shades are fully open.</li>
</ol>

<p>
As you can see by examining the two tables of combinations above the new combinations were
not particularly compatible with the older rolls.
<p>
*!!!!* Roll 471e.mes at 2mins 02secs selects 6A+ (the scan is clean and there is no doubt about it) and
then goes on to play notes only on the Great organ -- so this clearly IS used. I suspect the same is true
for 5A+ but have not yet proved it.
<h3>5.0 "New Music" stage 2, late 1920's. Rolls 1100 and above</h3>
These rolls are not compatible with earlier rolls.
<p>
Shades open (hole 124), shades close (hole 123) and hole 116 are selected simultaneously at the beginning
of these rolls to indicate New Music Stage 2.
<ol>
<li>** Tracker hole 121 is used with sc1 to sc6 and simultaneous shades open and close to extend the existing 24 combinations.
There is no information as to how these extra combinations were instrumented.</li>
<li>*** Tracker holes 118 and 120 were claimed to be used as controls to make all 32 Pedal notes playable, however these holes are NEVER
USED on any of the Stage 2 New Music rolls currently in my archive. In spite if this the extra pedal notes marked **** ARE used in all of the
aforementioned archived rolls.</li>
<li>**** It is logical to assume that these holes were used as the additional pedal notes. However I have made a special version
of eplayestey which plays these five extra notes as midi notes 48 to 52  (i.e. adding five extra notes to the top of the known pedal scale).
Many of the extra notes are off beat and make no musical sense to me. If anyone is interested I can supply standard midi files of all four
tunes with the "extra pedal notes" playing.</li>
</ol>
I would be pleased to hear from anyone who can clarify or add to this.
