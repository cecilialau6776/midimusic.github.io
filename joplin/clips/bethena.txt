Bethena & Scott Joplin "Their Story"
from Catherine Keller 3 months ago

I wrote this story a few years ago while learning the song "Bethena" on the piano.
I was intrigued to find that this was Scott Joplin's first composition that he published nearly six months after the death of his new bride of ten weeks, Freddie Alexander, on September 10th, 1904 at age 20.
This song is hauntingly beautiful with the mood changing quickly from solace, to joy, to sadness.
I couldn't help but wonder if Joplin was telling the story of his love with Freddie through this composition which in turn became my inspiration for writing the story.
I created this video slideshow to share "their story" with family and friends.
