<h3>A Picture Of Her Face, Lyrics</h3>
<p class="small"> Written by Scott Joplin, 1895.
</p>
(Piano Intro.)<br>
This life is very sad to me, a sorrow fills my heart<br>
My story I will tell to you, from me my love did part<br>
The village church bell sadly tolled, the one I loved had died<br>
She was a treasure more than gold when she was by my side<br>
But now she's gone beyond recall, in a silent tomb she sleeps<br>
The one I love yet best of all has left me here to weep<br>
Though death so ruthless stole my love, my dear and only Grace<br>
I've yet a treasure in this world: a picture of her face<br>
<p>
(Chorus)<br>
It brings joy to me<br>
When oft-times sad at heart<br>
Her picture I can see<br>
And sad thoughts then depart<br>
Although my love is dead<br>
My only darling Grace<br>
My eyes are oft-times looking on<br>
A picture of her face<br>
<p>
(Piano Intro.)<br>
I'll ne'er forget the days I've passed, with Grace so kind and true<br>
She was to me each day more joy than all the girls I knew<br>
My love for her will ne'er grow cold though she has passed away<br>
I'll love her still when I am old e'en to my dying day<br>
But now I must content myself, her memory to love<br>
For Grace the darling of my heart is in the land above<br>
But still to cheer me at my home an image of dear Grace<br>
Is all the treasure I now have, a picture of her face<br>
<p>
(Repeat chorus)<br>
(Piano Finale)</p>
