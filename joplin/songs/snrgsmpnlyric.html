<h3>Snoring Sampson, Lyrics</h3>
<p class="small"> Written by Harry La Mertha, 1907.
</p>
(Piano Intro. and Vamp)<br>
Sam-uel Samp-son was a coon with a bas--so voice,<br>
He was kind - and true -<br>
To a lit tle dusk-y maid-en that he - made - his choice<br>
in - nine--teen two.<br>
Ev-'ry time they went to bed there was a big up-roar,<br>
For when it came to snor-ing, Samp-son had - the floor -<br>
One night this dusk-y la-dy was a feel-ing might-y sore,<br>
And this she said to Sam-uel Samp-son 
<p>
(Chorus)<br>
I tell you Mis-ter Samp-son, You must stop that snore,<br>
or I'll - ski-doo<br>
I don't like a fog-horn in the mid-dle of the night,<br>
I'm a tell--ing you<br>
I tells you that I loves you and I hate - to squeal<br>
but, I in-form-a-tion you this bed's no au-to mo-bile.<br>
Samp-son I'm a tell--ing you<br>
(Repeat)<br>
<p>
Sam-uel loved his wife-y and he--said, I see<br>
I - both--ers you,<br>
So hon--y - when I wakes you in the - mid-dle of the night<br>
with a bass - ta-too,<br>
Ev-'ry time I el-o-cutes that honk ____ honk ____ snore,<br>
Put your feet a-gin ma back and shove me out on the floor.<br>
But, Ma-til-dah shout-ed loud-er "no, I'll just show you the door,<br>
- Sam - u-el Simp-son Samp-son.<br>
<p>
(Repeat Chorus)
