<h3>I Am Thinking Of My Pickaninny Days, Lyrics</h3>
<p class="small"> Written by Henry Jackson, 1901.
</p>
(Piano Intro.)<br>
An old dar-key lay a sleep-ing in his north-ern home - one night,<br>
He was dream-ing of the sun-ny south where first he saw the light,<br>
You could tell he was as hap-py as a - bird up in a tree,<br>
By the smile so bright up on his face that you could - plain-ly see,<br>
But - when this dar-key did a-wake and saw 'twas all a dream<br>
He call'd his lit-tle child-ren to his side<br>
And - when they said "My dad-dy dear, what makes you look so pleased?"<br>
These are the words to them he did re-ply.
<p>
(Chorus)<br>
"I am think-ing of my pick-a-nin-ny days<br>
And to-night my heart is filled with un-told joy<br>
They - bring to me sweet mem'-ries long gone bye<br>
When I was a pick-a-nin-ny boy<br>
And - could they but on-ly come a-gain<br>
The Lord for-ev-er I will praise<br>
Now that is why I look so pleased,<br>
I am think-ing of my pick-a-nin-ny days."
<p>
Since this dar-key told of boy hood days, it has been ma-ny a year,<br>
And - now the old man's laid a-way his mem'-ry still is here<br>
His - chil-dren now are grown in age and have pick-a-nin-nies too,<br>
Ev-'ry eve-'ning when their work is o'er, they think of their fa-ther true,<br>
All are gath-ered 'round the fire-side now and talk-ing of the past<br>
And of their dad in Hea-ven far a-way<br>
For - when they sat at his bed-side just as he breath's his last,<br>
These are the gen-tle words they heard him say.
<p>
(Repeat Chorus)</p>
