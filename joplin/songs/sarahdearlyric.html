<h3>Sarah Dear, Lyrics</h3>
<p class="small"> Written by Henry Jackson, 1905.
</p>
(Piano Intro.)<br>
Just a-bout the time that I fall a-sleep, I'm thinking of my Sa-rah dear;<br>
And as I a-wake from my slum-ber deep, I'm still think-ing of Sa-rah dear;<br>
When e'er I get a glimpse of you dear girl, my heart is filled with glee;<br>
When you are with me-- it's pleasure you see,-- with you I long to be.
<p>
(Chorus)<br>
O! you are my Sa-rah dear, the sun-light of my soul;---<br>
You have won my heart and hand All of my love you stole;<br>
You are sweet-ness to my lips your ten-der voice I love to hear,-<br>
And when I am near,- you've noth-ing to fear,- be-lieve me Sa-rah dear.
<p>
You're the sweet-est girl that I could find, you my Sa-rah dear;<br>
And you caused a thought to come to my mind, you my Sa-rah dear;<br>
I've a ques-tion that I would ask of you, you can make me hap-py through life;<br>
And when we're a-lone the truth will be known, I'll ask you to be my wife.
<p>
(Repeat Chorus)
