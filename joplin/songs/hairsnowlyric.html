<h3> When Your Hair Is Like The Snow, Lyrics</h3>
<p class="small"> Written by Owen Spendthrift, 1907.
</p>
(Piano Intro.)<br>
An aged couple seated by the firelight's cheerful glow,<br>
Reviewed their happy courtship of the distant long ago.<br>
The scene reverts to sadness as that scroll of time unrolled,<br>
A letter then to write they plan, this couple gray and old.<br>
Far o'er the sea their only boy had gone to join the fray,<br>
Their lonely watch they kept for him as years rolled on their way.<br>
At last they sent this message to that distant foreign land,<br>
"We miss you dear, we're old and poor," and thus the letter ran:
<p>
(Chorus)<br>
Our hair is like the snow, Our cheeks have lost their glow,<br>
Our eyes no longer sparkle like the dew.<br>
At life's twilight, old and gray, we have waited day by day,<br>
Will your children then desert you, when your hair is like the snow.
<p>
(Piano)<br>
The captain of the regiment, a soldier young and fair,<br>
Beloved by comrades, feared by foes, received the missive there;<br>
He read each line, then turned away to hide the tears that fell,<br>
What battles fought within that heart no tongue can ever tell.<br>
"I'll go!" he said, "To Mother dear, and Father kind and true,<br>
I'll leave these crimson battle fields for lands where skies are blue."<br>
He hurried home across the foam, alas! but all in vain,<br>
Beneath the weeping willows there he read these lines again:
<p>
(Repeat Chorus)
