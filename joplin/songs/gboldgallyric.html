<h3>Good-bye Old Gal Goodbye, Lyrics</h3>
<p class="small"> Written by Mac Darden, 1906.
</p>
(Piano Intro.)<br>
It's no use gal I'm go-ing to leave you Can't square your self - with me.<br>
I'm go-ing to fol-low them Big Four tracks If my feet wear to the knee.<br>
I've been do-ing that por-ter work - morn-ing night and noon,<br>
While you keep the pork-chops hid from me and feed 'em to some oth-er coon.<br> 
So take one last fond lov - ing look just gaze like on the dead.<br>
Cause I'm go-ing so far I can't find my-self so re-mem-ber these words I said:
<p>
(Chorus)<br>
I say good-bye, bye, bye, old gal A good, good-bye to you<br>
Just say good-bye to all my friends And say that we are through.<br>
Now don't think I'll come back to you For you know the rea-son why,<br>
I'm going to toot, toot like the en-gines do, so good-bye old gal good-bye<br>
I say good-bye, bye, bye, old gal A good, good-bye to you<br>
Just say good-bye to all my friends And say that we are through.<br>
Now don't think I'll come back to you For you know the rea-son why,<br>
I'm going to toot, toot like the en-gines do, so good-bye old gal good-bye.
<p>
Now Sam tramped all a-round - the world--And lived on bread - and hash,<br>
One day - he saved - a rich man's life - and got one mil-lion cash,<br>
So Sam re-turned to his na-tive town With dia-monds and a high silk hat,<br>
He rode a-round in an au-to-mo-bile and rent-ed a big swell flat -<br>
In a week he bought - a yacht and start-ed to sail a-way<br>
When his old - gal said - don't I go too - these words she hear him say:<br>
<p>
(Repeat Chorus)
