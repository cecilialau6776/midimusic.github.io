<h3>Lovin' Babe, Lyrics</h3>
<p class="small">Lyrics by Al. R. Turner, 1911
</p>
(Piano Intro.)<br>
Strol-ling thro' the park,<br>
 - out on a lark,<br>
I happened to meet Miss De-li-lah -<br>
Dress'd so ve-ry neat, -<br>
man-ners ve-ry sweet,<br>
To capture her was my de-sire -<br>
She - gim-me a glance,<br>
I took a chance,<br>
To sit down by her side;<br>
I told her what I'd do,<br>
and that I'd be true,<br>
Then to me - she - re-plied,
<p>
(Chorus)<br>
You'se a gent-'man you is too,<br>
Ev-'ry inch of you,<br>
lov-in' ba-by lov-in' ba - by.<br>
I thought I'd drive you a-way - -<br>
But now I'm goin' to let you stay.<br>
O, - - ba-by lov-in' babe.<br>
You'se been so good an' kind<br>
You'se done 'plete-ly changed my mind,<br>
lov-in' ba-by lov-in' ba-by<br>
If I look this whole world through,<br>
I'd nev-er find an-oth-er man like you.<br>
And that's no may-be lov-in' babe.
<p>
We had a long - chat,<br>
there as - we sat -<br>
in the shade of the trees, -<br>
I asked - - to know,<br>
to be her stea-dy beau,<br>
And these words seemed to - please her.<br>
She be-gan - to blush,<br>
said, "Man, you hush,<br>
You sho is work-in' fas';<br>
I likes - you, -<br>
'deed I - do, -<br>
'Cause you cert'n-ly - has got some class"
<p>
(Repeat Chorus)
