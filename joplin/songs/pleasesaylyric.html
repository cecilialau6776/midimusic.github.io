<h3>Please Say You Will, Lyrics</h3>
<p class="small"> Written by Scott Joplin, 1895.
</p>
(Piano Intro.)<br>
Closed in the parlor we are alone,<br>
Happy to be with one that I love.<br>
I'll ask you kindly, Oh Mamie dove,<br>
Do speak just a few words to bind us in love.<br>
I will confess that I have been false,<br>
The other girl was really the cause;<br>
She is a flirt too, and never still,<br>
I don't love none but you, Please say you will.
<p>
(Chorus)<br>
Must I plead, must I kneel, and you not forgive?<br>
Has your heart, love, been sealed? Do you love me still?<br>
You have always been true. Now why not forgive?<br>
I don't love none but you, Please say you will.<br>
<p>
Oh Mamie loved one don't treat me so,<br>
You have forsaken, where will I go,<br>
Bowed on my knees I pray once again,<br>
Forgive me my loved one for I am to blame.<br>
Once you were kind and kissed me so sweet,<br>
The other girl has fooled me complete,<br>
Now I will live true, why not forgive,<br>
I don't love none but you, Please say you will.<br>
<p>
(Repeat Chorus)<br>
<p>
Now we must part love. I'll ask again,<br>
Don't let this pleading be all in vain;<br>
You know I love you. Why not forgive?<br>
For my heart is broken, Oh please say you will.<br>
Let us agree love, open your heart,<br>
Don't let that flirt now keep us apart.<br>
I am so humble and pleading still,<br>
I don't love none but you, Please say you will.<br>
<p>
(Repeat Chorus)
