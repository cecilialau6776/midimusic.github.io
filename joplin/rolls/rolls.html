<P>
I agree that Joplin most probably did play the marking piano at
Connorized. He was in the right place in the right time, and
Connorized certainly made much of the fact. In fact, I've seen an
Edwin F. Kendall-played Connorized roll that was produced roughly the
same time as the Joplin rolls. I had no idea Mike Montgomery had put
up the idea already, and if there's some evidence that Kendall was
friends with Joplin, is a great theory that fills in all the blanks.

<H3>1. Quantization.</H3>

If you examine the Connorized Joplin rolls, you'll note that they are
mathematically perfect - ie, every crotchet, quaver, etc. is lined up
with the other notes in the chord, the note duration is exactly the
same. They are the equivalent of a 'sequenced MIDI'.
<P>
Compare with the Aeolian Uni-Record rolls, which are completely
mathematically imprecise - you can see this simply by loading any
Uni-Record roll MIDI into Cakewalk or a similar programme. This is not
a reflection on the pianist's ability. No pianist is capable of
playing exactly mathematically correctly - not even a Rachmaninov, a
Hoffman, or a Gould.
<P>
Mike Montgomery has been studying piano rolls longer than I've been
alive, and I don't doubt he's fully aware of this already!

<H3>2. Recording Facilities.</H3>

We know Aeolian used a recording piano in their New York studios that
perforated a master roll directly as the pianist played, with the
first master being accurate to 1/60th of a second for each key
depression.
<P>
We know little about Connorized's production methods except that they
probably used a marking or stencilling recording piano as most roll
companies did. This created a master roll marked with carbon, which
then had to be perforated by hand, with all the opportunities for
mistakes, corrections, etc that this entailed.

<H3>3. Marketing and Production Style.</H3>

Every newspaper in the world has a 'style guide' - containing a list
of 'banned words', fonts to use in different circumstances, the
newspaper's 'official' spelling of a word with more than one spelling
option, etc. Roll companies were no different, and all had their own
'musical style guide', which may have varied from arranger to
arranger, but the machinery and equipment available dictated a large
part remain consistent.
<P>
When we compare fifty or so Connorized rolls with the equivalent
number of Aeolian Uni-Record rolls, we see an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
marketing philosophy.
<P>
The Connorized rolls are strictly mathematically quantitized, they
normally utilized 'house artists' who weren't &quot;famous&quot; per se,
they are often embellished far and beyond what a single human with ten
fingers could play.
<P>
Aeolian, on the other hand, was many times the size of Connorized, and
had different brands for different styles of roll. There were the
normal, mathematically arranged rolls, which you added your
interpretation to. There were Metro-Art (hand played rolls that seem
to have been embellished in places), MelODee (hand played rolls that
were quantitized and edited), and the list goes on!
<P>
The Uni-Record rolls were marketed as being "faithful records of the
hand performances of eminent pianists. More than this, they represent
the best efforts of each individual pianist. From a large number of
records which the pianist makes of each composition, the one is
selected in which both technique and mood are at their highest pitch
of inspiration."
<P>
From my studies of Uni-Record rolls, they appear to have had very
little editing done - I've never seen one that wasn't achievable with
ten fingers, and they all contain rubato, shortened and increased note
lengths, and other very human traits. By contrast, many of the
Connorized 'Guaranteed Hand Played Records' (the sub-brand the Joplin
rolls were released on) are striking fifteen notes at a time, there is
no rubato, no note that's not mathematically perfect.

<H3>4. Embellishments and Variations.</H3>

The Joplin Uni-Record roll contains a few minor deviations from the
printed score but the bass octave embellishments which are so noticeable
in the Connorized Joplin rolls are completely absent. When you compare
Connorized rolls credited to Connorized staff artist William 'Billy'
Axtmann (aka 'William Arlington'), the bass runs are present in rolls
made years before Joplin showed up.
<P>
For anyone to claim that Joplin just happened, by coincidence, to use
the exact same bass runs in April 1916 as a company arranger was
using, then drop them completely two months later for a recording for
a different company. is stretching the bounds of credulity. So if you
agree with me and discount the bass runs as being added
post-production by Axtmann during the editing process, what do we have
left? The performance has already been corrected to be mathematically
accurate, so you have pretty much nothing of Joplin left, with the
possible exception of the Magnetic Rag slower intro, and the arpeggios
present in Pleasant Moments.
<P>
By comparison, you have a Uni-Record roll that was punched directly as
the pianist played, bearing all the hallmarks of a human performance
with apparently little editing done to 'fix it up'. In the case of
Joplin, who apparently never made any acoustic recordings, this is
going to be infinitely more valuable than a completely mathematical,
quantitized reproduction of the Maple Leaf rag score with a few later
embellishments that appear to bear all the hallmarks of someone else!

<H3>5. Step Rate of Production Rolls.</H3>

Connorized rolls of the Joplin era used an EXTREMELY coarse step rate
for the perforators. This dictated how many possible 'punch' locations
there were per inch of paper. The Connorized Joplin rolls use a step
rate of 132 rows per foot. That's only 11 possible locations for the
note to start or finish per inch of paper. Sounds like a lot, but in
practise, for genuine handplayed recordings, is fairly useless.
Rubato, broken chords, arpeggios, minute timing variations will all
sound jerky and imprecise unless mathematically perfect.
<P>
Compare that with the Aeolian Uni-Record rolls, which use a step rate
of 408 rows per foot. That's the highest step-rate I've seen of ANY
roll of that era, higher even than the Ampico and Duo-Art rolls which
were reproducing classical performances by the most famous pianists in
the world. Our Uni-Record editor now has the choice of 34 different
note on/off positions per inch! He can pack three times more accurate
information from the recording master into an inch than the Connorized
men can.

<H3>6. Conclusion.</H3>

Thus, it is unlikely that the Connorized production rolls contain
any useful information about Joplin's playing style, with the POSSIBLE
exception of the slower Magnetic Rag introduction, the arpeggios in
Pleasant Moments that don't appear in the sheet music. I do believe
that the single Aeolian Uni-Record roll credited to him is an
extremely close reproduction of his playing, virtually unedited.
