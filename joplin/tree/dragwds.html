1.  The Slow Drag must begin on the first beat of each measure.<BR>
2.  When moving forward, drag the left foot;  when moving backward, drag the right foot.<BR>
3.  When moving sideways to the right, drag left foot;  when moving sideways to left, drag right foot.<BR>
4.  When prancing, your steps must come on each beat of the measure.<BR>
5.  When marching and when sliding, your steps must come on the first and the third beat of each measure.<BR>
6.  Hop and skip on second beat of each measure.  Double the Schottische step to fit the slow music.<P></EM>

Look to your right and do the drag.<BR>
To your left, that's the way.<P>
<EM>(All stop, salute partners, and then march, doing the dude walk.)</EM><P>

Happy as a bird in June.<BR>
Sliding onward, sliding onward,<BR>
Listen to that rag.<P>
Hop and skip,<BR>
Now do that Slow Drag.<P>
Dance slowly, prance slowly,<BR>
While you hear that pretty rag.<BR>

Walk slowly, talk lowly, <P>
