<H3>Preface.</H3>
The Scene of the Opera is laid on a plantation somewhere in the State of Arkansas,
Northeast of the Town of Texarkana and three or four miles from the Red River. The
plantation being surrounded by a dense forest.</P>
<P>There were several negro families living on the plantation and other families back in
the woods.</P>
<P>In order that the reader may better comprehend the story, I will give a few details
regarding the Negroes of this plantation from the year 1866 to the year 1884.</P>
<P>The year 1866 finds them in dense ignorance, with no-one to guide them, as the white
folks had moved away shortly after the Negroes were set free and had left the plantation
in charge of a trustworthy negro servant named Ned.</P>
<P>All of the negroes, but Ned and his wife Monisha, were superstitious, and believed in
conjuring. Monisha, being a woman, was at times impressed by what the more expert
conjurers would say.</P>
<P>Ned and Monisha had no children, and they had often prayed that their cabin home might
one day be brightened by a child that would be a companion for Monisha when Ned was away
from home. They had dreams, too, of educating the child so that when it grew up it could
teach the people around them to aspire to something better and higher than superstition
and conjuring.</P>
<P>The prayers of Ned and Monisha were answered in a remarkable manner. One morning in the
middle of September 1866, Monisha found a baby under a tree that grew in front of her
cabin. It proved to be a light-brown-skinned girl about two days old. Monisha took the
baby into her cabin, and Ned and she adopted it as their own.</P>
<P>They wanted the child, while growing up, to love them as it would have loved its real
parents, so they decided to keep it in ignorance of the manner in which it came to them
until old enough to understand. They realized, too, that if the neighbors knew the facts,
they would some day tell the child, so, to deceive them, Ned hitched up the mules and,
with Monisha and the child, drove over to a family of old friends who lived twenty miles
away and whom they had not seen for three years. They told their friends that the child
was just a week old.</P>
<P>Ned gave these people six bushels of corn and forty pounds of meat to allow Monisha and
the child to stay with them for eight weeks, which Ned thought would benefit the health of
Monisha. The friends willingly consented to have her stay with them for that length of
time.</P>
<P>Ned went back alone to the plantation and told his old neighbors that Monisha, while
visiting some old friends, had become mother of a girl baby.</P>
<P>The neighbors were, of course, greatly surprised, but were compelled to believe that
Ned's story was true.</P>
<P>At the end of the eight weeks Ned took Monisha and the child home and received the
congratulations of his neighbors and friends and was delighted to find that his scheme had
worked so well.</P>
<P>Monisha, at first, gave the child her own name; but when the child was three years old,
she was so fond of playing under the tree where she was found that Monisha gave her the name
of Tree-Monisha.</P>
<P>When Treemonisha was seven years old Monisha arranged with a white family that she
would do their washing and ironing and Ned would chop their wood if the lady of the house
would give Treemonisha an education, the schoolhouse being too far away for the child to
attend. The lady consented and as a result Treemonisha was the only educated person in the
neighborhood, the other children being still in ignorance on account of their inability to
travel so far to school.</P>
<P>Zodzetrick, Luddud, and Simon, three very old men, earned their living by going about
the neighborhood practicing conjuring, selling little luck-bags and rabbits' feet, and
confirming the people in their superstition.</P>
<P>This strain of music is the principal strain in the Opera and
represents the happiness of the people when they feel free from the conjurers and their
spells of superstition. The opera begins in September 1884. Treemonisha, being eighteen
years old, now starts upon her career as a teacher and leader.</P>
