<h3>5: The Wreath</h3>
<B>Treemonisha</B>:<BR>
You girls are wearing wreaths on your heads,<BR>

<I>Monisha opens the cabin door and stands, listening.</I>

<P>
And I am wearing a bonnet instead.<P>

<B>Lucy</B>:<BR>
You should wear a wreath made of pretty leaves.<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B>:<BR>
Now to make my wreath, I see,<BR>
I must have leaves from that tree.<P>

<B>Monisha</B>:<BR>
No!  Not a leaf from dat tree take,<BR>
Leave 'em there, child, for my sake,<BR>
Take 'em from another tree,<BR>
An' very fine yo' wreath will be.<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B>:<BR>
There are pretty leaves on this tree so near,<BR>
But, to please you, I'll to another tree go.<BR>
Tell me why this tree is, to you, so dear?<P>

<B>Chorus</B>:<BR>
Please tell us, we would all like to know.
