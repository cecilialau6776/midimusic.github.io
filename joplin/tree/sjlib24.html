<h3>24: When Villains Ramble Far And Near (A Lecture)</h3>
<B>Ned</B>:<BR>
When villains ramble far and near,<BR>
To break the people's laws,<BR>
Their punishment should be severe,<BR>
Within the devil's claws.<P>

When villains ramble far and near,<BR>
With their hearts full of sin,<BR>
They do much wrong without a fear,<BR>
But someday right will win.<P>

We stay close at home,<BR>
When villains rambling we can hear,<BR>
We have no chance to roam,<BR>
When heartless villains are so near.<P>

We dare not sleep at night,<BR>
When we have an awful fear.<BR>
We keep a brilliant light,<BR>
When villains ramble far and near.<P>

When villains ramble far and near,<BR>
And cause great alarm,<BR>
We wish for them a short career,<BR>
Before they do great harm.<P>

When villains ramble far and near,<BR>
Top treat other people bad,<BR>
They should be despatched to the other sphere,<BR>
To make old Satan feel glad.<P>

We stay close at home,<BR>
When villains rambling we can hear,<BR>
We have no chance to roam,<BR>
When heartless villains are so near.<P>

We dare not sleep at night,<BR>
When we have an awful fear.<BR>
We keep a brilliant light,<BR>
When villains ramble far and near.
