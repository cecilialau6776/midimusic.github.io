<H2>Act III Synopsis</H2>
Ned comforts Monisha, who is worried about her daughter (<I>I Want to See My Child</I>). Remus and Treemonisha return, followed by men from the neighborhood who have captured Zodzetrick and
Luddud (<I>Treemonisha's Return</I>).
<P>
The neighbors threaten to beat the conjurors but Treemonisha
stops them and asks them to instead lecture the two men and let them go. Remus supports
Treemonisha's position, pointing out that that <I>Wrong is Never Right</I>.  Not completely convinced, the neighbors again hurl <I>Abuse</I> at the conjurors, only to be stopped by Treemonisha.
<P>
 The conjurors receive a lecture from Ned (<I>When Villains Ramble Far and Near</I>) and are
 released with the wary forgiveness of the neighborhood (<I>Conjurors Forgiven</I>).
<P>
Impressed with Treemonisha's rational and nonviolent response to the incident, the neighbors - men
and women alike - ask her to be the leader of the community (<I>We Will Trust You as Our
Leader</I>). Treemonisha accepts, and leads her neighbors in dancing <I>A Real Slow Drag</I>.
