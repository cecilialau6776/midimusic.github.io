<h3>8: Treemonisha's Bringing Up</h3>
<B>Monisha</B>:<BR>
We brought you up to believe that we were your real parents.<BR>
We saw nothing wrong in doing so.<P>

On a dark still night,<BR>
Ned hitched up the old mules, and taking you,<BR>
We were soon driving along the road,<BR>
And the next day were twenty miles away.<BR>
Calling on some friends,<BR>
We told them that you were our first-born and that I intended to stay at<BR>
their house for eight weeks for the benefit of my health.<P>

The neighbors were much surprised as what we told them,<BR>
But of course believed us,<BR>
And so you have never learned the secret of your birth until now.<P>

When you were seven years old,<BR>
There being no school in the neighborhood,<BR>
A white lady undertook your education.<P>

<I>She points to the trunk of the sacred tree.</I><P>I found you on that spot,<BR>
And your parents I know not;<BR>
Ned and I love you true;<BR>
You have been a faithful daughter.<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B>:<BR>
I love you and Ned too,<BR>
And your bidding I will do.<BR>
To me you have been a mother,<BR>
And Ned has been a father.<P>

<B>Monisha</B>:<BR>
When you were a little child of years only three,<BR>
You were the most contented while playing near that tree.<BR>
Monisha first I named you,<BR>
The honor was for me.<BR>
Treemonisha next I named you,<BR>
Because you loved that tree.<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B>:<BR>
I will take leaves from another tree,<BR>
And very fine my wreath will be.<P>

<B>Corn-Huskers</B>:<BR>
Take them from another tree,<BR>
And very fine your wreath will be.<P>

<I>Treemonisha and Lucy go among the trees.</I>
