<h3>26: We Will Trust You As Our Leader</h3>
<B>Treemonisha</B>: <BR>
We ought to have a leader<BR>
In our neighborhood,<BR>
An energetic leader,<BR>
To follow for our good.<P>

The ignorant too long have ruled,<BR>
I don't see why they should.<BR>
And all the people they have fooled,<BR>
Because the found they could.<P>

<B>Chorus</B>:<BR>
We will trust you as our leader,<BR>
We will trust you as our leader,<BR>
No one else could lead like you,<BR>
For you know what is best to do.<P>

We will trust you as our leader,<BR>
We will trust you as our leader,<BR>
You must lead for you are wise,<BR>
And we will surely rise.<P>

We want you to lead,<BR>
You should lead us.<P>

Dear, your bidding we will do.<BR>
And we'll always follow you.<BR>
We feel blue, dear,<BR>
We feel blue.<P>

We will trust you as our leader,<BR>
We will trust you as our leader.<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B>: <BR>
If I lead the good women,<BR>
Tell me, who will lead the men?<P>

<B>Men</B>:<BR>
You, you, you, you, you!<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B>: <BR>
Women may follow me many days long,<BR>
But the men may think that I am wrong.<P>

<B>Men</B>:<BR>
No, no, no, no, no!<P>

<B>Chorus</B> <I>all</I>:<BR>
We all agree to trust you,<BR>
And we will be true.<BR>
We all agree to trust you,<BR>
And we will be true.<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B>: <BR>
There's need of some good leader,<BR>
And there's not much time to wait.<BR>
To lead us in the right way<BR>
Before it is too late.<P>

For ignorance is criminal<BR>
In this enlightened day.<BR>
So let us all get busy,<BR>
When once we have found the way.<P>

<B>Chorus</B>:<BR>
We will trust you as our leader,<BR>
We will trust you as our leader, etc.<P>
 
Lead now, please lead now,<BR>
Please lead, for we will trust your as our leader.<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B>: <BR>
I will lead you;<BR>
O yes, I will lead you.
