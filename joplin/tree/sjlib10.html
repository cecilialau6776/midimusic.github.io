<h3>10: Confusion</h3>
<B>Monisha</B>:<BR>
Look!  Lucy is comin' back,<BR>
I don't see Treemonisha.<BR>
I hope there's nothing wrong;<BR>
Lucy has something over her mouth,<BR>
An' her hands are tired behind her.<P>

<B>Chorus</B>:<BR>
What is de trouble, Lucy?<BR>
What's wrong, Lucy?<P>

<I>Lucy enters and falls to the ground exhausted.
<P>

All gather around Lucy.  Monisha unties Lucy's hands and takes the<BR>
handkerchief from over her mouth.  Lucy then sits up.</I>
<P>
<B>Chorus</B>:<BR>
Speak!  Lucy, Speak!  Speak!<BR>
Where is Treemonisha?<BR>
Speak to me, please speak to me!<BR>
Speak, Speak, Speak, Speak,<BR>
Speak to me!<P>

<B>Lucy</B>:<BR>
Zodzetrick an' Luddud have tied a han'kerchief over Treemonisha's mouth,<BR>
An' have tied her han's behind her jes' lak dey tied mine.<P>

<B>Chorus</B>:<BR>
Tell it quick, quick!  Tell it quick!<P>

<B>Lucy</B>:<BR>
An' Zodzetrick got on his mule's back<BR>
An' lifted Treemonisha on after him,<BR>
Den galloped away into de woods.<P>

<B>Women</B>:<BR>
Oh!<BR>

<I>Crying</I>

O!<P>

<I>Lucy rises and begins to cry.</I>
<P>

<B>Women</B> <I>Spoken in crying tones</I>:<BR>
Go an' bring her back, boys.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Men</B> <I>Speaking in crying tones</I>:<BR>
We will bring her back.<P>

<I>The corn-husking boys run down the road after the conjurors.  Remus<BR>
goes to the corn-field, gets the scarecrow suit and disguises himself<BR>
to follow and frighten the conjurors.</I>
<P>

<B>Women</B> <I>in crying tones</I>:<BR>
O!  O!  O!  O!<BR>
<BR>

<I>Ned comes running from the field.</I>
<P>

<B>Ned</B>:<BR>
Hey!  Monisha, speak!<BR>
Where is Treemonisha an' de boys?<P>

<B>Monisha</B>:<BR>
Among the trees to gather leaves<BR>
Treemonisha and Lucy went,<BR>
They thought not of the conjurous thieves,<BR>
While on their pleasure bent.<P>
But Zodzetrick and Luddud made haste while they could,<BR>

They have captured Treemonisha, and their threats they have made good.<P>

The boys went to rescue her and bring her back to me,<BR>
She is our only daughter, and with us she ought to be.<P>

<B>Ned</B>:<BR>
I'll beat dat trifling Zodzetrick,<BR>
Until he runs lak a big cur dog,<BR>
And I'll kill dat scoundrel Luddud,<BR>

<I>Enter Remus</I>

Jus' lak I would kill a hog.<P>

<B>Remus</B>:<BR>
I'll wear dis ugly scarecrow,<BR>

<I>He puts on the scarecrow suit.</I>

While through the woods I roam,<BR>
'Twill scare away the conjurors,<BR>
And I'll bring Treemonisha home.<BR>

<I>He goes running down the road.<P>

Ned, Monisha, and the girls look at Remus as he runs down the road.</I><P>

<B>Chorus</B>:<BR>
Run faster, Remus, Remus,<BR>
Keep straight ahead.<BR>
Run faster, Remus, Remus,<BR>
Keep straight ahead.<P>
