To scare the conjurors away from me,<BR>
Remus wore that old scarecrow.<P>

<I>They stand the prisoners in the middle of the room.  The others<BR>
circle around them.</I>

<I>The men advance toward Zodzetrick and Luddud, raising their<BR>
fists threateningly.</I>
<P>

<B>Chorus</B>:<BR>
You must beat them hard.<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B>:<BR>
Stop!<P>

<I>The men stop, drop their hands quickly to their sides, and step<BR>
backward to where they first stood.</I>
<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B>:<BR>
You will do evil for evil,<BR>
If you strike them you know;<BR>
Just give them a severe lecture,<BR>
And let them freely go.<P>

<B>Zodzetrick and Luddud</B>:<BR>

<B>Treemonisha</B> <I>To Andy and pointing to conjurors</I>:<BR>
Andy, make them free!<P>

<I>Andy does not move.  All look with surprise at Treemonisha.</I>
<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B> <I>More forcibly</I>:<BR>
Make them free!<P>

<I>Andy removes the ropes from conjurers wrists.</I>
<P>

<B>Others</B> <I>Grunting their disapproval</I>:<BR>
