<h3>22: Wrong Is Never Right (A Lecture)</h3>
<B>Remus</B>:<BR>
Never treat your neighbors wrong,<BR>
By making them feel blue;<BR>
Remember that the whole day long<BR>
The Creator is watching you.<P>

Never do wrong for revenge,<BR>
In the day or night;<BR>
Wrong must not on right infringe,<BR>
For wrong is never right.<P>

Wrong is never right,<BR>
That is very true,<BR>
Wrong is never right,<BR>
And wrong you should not do.<BR>
Wrong is never right,<BR>
You will agree with me;<BR>
Wrong is never right,<BR>
And it will never be.<P>

Never treat your neighbors wrong,<BR>
By causing them to grieve,<BR>
Help the weak if you are strong,<BR>
And never again deceive.<P>

Your deeds should please heaven's throng,<BR>
For you are in their sight,<BR>
You should never think of wrong,<BR>
For wrong is never right.<P>

Wrong is never right,<BR>
That is very true,<BR>
Wrong is never right,<BR>
And wrong you should not do.<BR>
Wrong is never right,<BR>
You will agree with me;<BR>
Wrong is never right,<BR>
And it will never be.<P>

<B>Octet Chorus</B>:<BR>
Wrong is never right,<BR>
That is very true,<BR>
Wrong is never right,<BR>
And wrong you should not do.<BR>
<BR>
Do right, Wrong never do.<BR>
Do right, right do.<BR>
<BR>
Wrong is never right,<BR>
You will agree with me;<BR>
Wrong is never right,<BR>
And it will never be.<BR>
<BR>
Wrong is never right,<BR>
You will agree with me;<BR>
Do right,<BR>
