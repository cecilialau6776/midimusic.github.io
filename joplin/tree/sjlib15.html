<h3>15: The Rescue</h3>
<I>Remus takes off the Scarecrow suit and folds it on one arm, still<BR>
looking toward conjurors.<P>

He approaches Treemonisha.</I><P>

<B>Treemonisha</B> <I>Puts her arms around his neck</I>:<BR>
Remus, you have saved me from the awful sting of the wasp.<BR>
They were going to push me on that wasp nest.<BR>

<I>Remus looks, horror-stricken, at the wasp-nest.</I><BR>

When one of them counted three.<BR>
But thanks to the great Creator,<BR>
You came in time to save me.<P>

<B>Remus</B>:<BR>
I am glad I came in time to save you<BR>
From the awful sting of the wasp.<BR>
And while on my way to your rescue,<BR>
Many hills and valleys I crossed.<BR>
I know the conjurors are superstitious,<BR>
And afraid of anything that looks strange,<BR>
So I wore the scarecrow for that purpose,<BR>
And have scared them away out of range.<BR>
Come, let us leave these woods at once,<BR>
Because I hear some very strange grunts.<P>

<I>Remus and Treemonisha leave, going in the opposite direction from the conjurors.<P>

The scene is suddenly changed to a cotton field; a wagon road is in front,<BR>
and men and women are seen picking cotton.</I>
