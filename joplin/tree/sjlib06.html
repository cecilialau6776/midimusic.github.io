<h3>6: The Sacred Tree</h3>
<B>Monisha</B>:<BR>
One Autumn night I was in bed lying,<BR>
Just eighteen years ago,<BR>
I heard a dear little baby crying,<BR>
While loudly Ned did snore.<BR>
And the baby's crying seemed to be<BR>
Somewhere near that sacred tree.<BR>
And the baby's crying seemed to be<BR>
Somewhere near that sacred tree.<P>

I called to Ned and said, "Wake up,<BR>
A baby is crying outside the door."<BR>
But Ned said, "You have dreamed enough,"<BR>
And went to sleep once more;<BR>
Yet the baby's crying seemed to be<BR>
Somewhere near that sacred tree.<BR>   
Yet the baby's crying seemed to be<BR>
Somewhere near that sacred tree.<P>

It was twelve o'clock, or just before,<BR>
When the rain fell hard and fast,<BR>
The baby's cries I heard no more,<BR>
It had gone to sleep at last.<BR>
And very quiet it seemed to be,<BR>
Somewhere near that sacred tree.<BR>
And very quiet it seemed to be,<BR>
Somewhere near that sacred tree.<P>

Ten o'clock next morning,<BR>
The hot sun was shining,<BR>
And the darling little baby,<BR>
I really had not forgotten;<BR>
But I could hear the humming bee,<BR>
Somewhere near that sacred tree.<BR>
And as I listened it seemed to be,<BR>
Somewhere near that sacred tree.<P> 

I came out in the yard to see,<BR>
And find out where the child could be;<BR>
And there, in rags, the baby laid,<BR>
Sheltered by that tree's cool shade.<BR>
I found it where I thought 'twould be,<BR>
There besides that sacred tree,<BR>
I found it where I thought 'twould be,<BR>
There besides that sacred tree.<P>

I took the child into our home,<BR>
And now the darling girl is grown,<BR>
All I've said to you is true,<BR>
The child I've told you of is you.<BR>
Take not a leaf but leave them be,<BR>
On that dear old sacred tree;<BR>
Take not a leaf but leave them be,<BR> 
On that dear old sacred tree.<P>

The rain or the burning sun, you see,<BR>
Would have sent you to your grave,<BR>
But the sheltering leaves of that old tree,<BR>
Your precious life did save.<BR>
So now with me you must agree,<BR>
Not to harm that sacred tree;<BR>
So now with me you must agree,<BR>
Not to harm that sacred tree.
