<h3>18: Aunt Dinah Has Blowed de Horn</h3>
<B>Chorus of Cotton Pickers</B>:<BR>
Aunt Dinah has blowed de horn,<BR>
An' we'll go home to stay until dawn.<BR>
Get ready, put yo' sack on yo' back,<BR>
I'm so happy I don't know how to act, how to act.<P>

Aunt Dinah has blowed de horn,<BR>
An' she wants us to come straight home,<BR>
We have not much time for delay,<BR>
'Cause our work is finished for today.<P>

O yes, Aunt Dinah has blowed de horn,<BR>
An' we'll go home to stay until dawn.<BR>
Get ready, keep yo' sack on yo' back,<BR>
I'm so happy I don't know how to act, how to act.<P>

Aunt Dinah has blowed de horn,<BR>
An' she wants us to come straight home,<BR>
We have not much time for delay,<BR>
'Cause our work is finished for today.
