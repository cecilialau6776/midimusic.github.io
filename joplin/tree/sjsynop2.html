<H2>Act II Synopsis</H2>
As a group of conjurors meet in the forest to receive instruction on the subject of
<I>Superstition</I>, Zodzetrick and Luddud arrive with Treemonisha, insisting that she be punished for threatening their livelihood (<I>Treemonisha in Peril</I>). They deliberate on an appropriate punishment, leaving her alone briefly amid wild forest animals
(<I>Frolic of the Bears</I>).
<P>
The conjurors decide to throw her in a large <I>Wasp Nest</I> and are
about to carry out their plan when Remus arrives in his scarecrow costume.  The
conjurors believe he is the devil and run away.
<P>
Treemonisha expresses her gratitude for Remus' well-timed <I>Rescue</I> and they start for home.
<P>
On their way through the fields
they meet a group of weary cotton pickers (<I>We Will Rest Awhile</I>), who give them
directions back to their plantation (<I>Going Home</I>). As Remus and Treemonisha head for home, the cotton pickers celebrate quitting time with a dance (<I>Aunt Dinah Has Blowed
de Horn</I>).
