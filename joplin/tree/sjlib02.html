<h3>2: The Bag Of Luck</h3>

<I>Zodzetrick enters.</I><P>

<B>Zodzetrick</B> <I>to Monisha</I>:<BR>
I want to sell to you dis bag o'luck,<BR>
Yo' enemies it will keep away.<BR>
Over yo' front do' you can hang it,<BR>
An' good luck will come each day.<P>

<B>Monisha</B>:<BR>
Will it drive away de blues?<BR>
An' stop Ned from drinkin' booze?<P>

<B>Zodzetrick</B>:<BR>
It will drive de blues, I'm thinkin',<BR>
An' will stop Ned from booze-drinkin'.<P>

<B>Monisha</B> <I>Reaching for bag</I>:<BR>
Well!<P>

<B>Ned</B> <I>Angrily</I>:<BR>
No, dat bag you'se not gwine to buy,<BR>
'Cause I know de price is high.<P>

<B>Zodzetrick</B>:<BR>
I mus' tell you plain an' bold,<BR>
It is worth its weight in gold.<P>

<B>Ned</B>:<BR>
It may be worth its weight in diamonds rare,<BR>
Or worth the earth to you.<BR>
But to me, it ain't worth a possum's hair,<BR>
Or persimmons when they're new.<BR>
Drinkin' gin I would not stop,<BR>
If dat bag was on my chin.<BR>
I'm goin' to drink an' work my crop,<BR>
'Cause I think it is no sin.<P>

<B>Monisha</B>:<BR>
Dis here bag will heaps o'luck bring,<BR>
An' we need here jes dis kind o' thing.<P>

<B>Ned</B>:<BR>
You shall not buy dat bag,<BR>
'Cause I don't want it here.<BR>
'Nough o' dat thing we've had.<BR>
'Twill do us harm, I fear.<P>

<I>To Zodzetrick</I>:<BR>
Say ole man, you won't do,<BR>
You's a stranger to me.<BR>
Tell me, who are you?<P>

<B>Zodzetrick</B>:<BR>
Zodzetrick --<BR>
I am de Goofer dus' man<BR>
An' I's king of Goofer dus' lan'.<BR>
Strange things appear when I says "Hee hoo!"<BR>
Strange things appear when I says "Hee hoo!"<P>


<I>Zodzetrick starts away.  Exit Ned.  Monisha goes into the
cabin.</I><P>

<B>Treemonisha</B> <I>To Zodzetrick</I>:<BR>
Wait, sir, for a few moments stay,<BR>
You should listen to what I have to say.<BR>
Please come closer to me, come along,<BR>
And I'll tell you of your great wrong.<P>

<I>Zodzetrick marks a cross on the ground, spits on it and turns
back.</I>
<P>

<B>Zodzetrick</B>:<BR>
I've come back, my dear child, to hear what you say,<BR>
Go on with your story, I can't stay all day.<P>

<B>Treemonisha</B>:<BR>
You have lived without working for many years.<BR>
All by your tricks of conjury.<BR>
You have caused superstition and many sad tears.<BR>
You should stop, you are doing great injury.<P>

<B>Zodzetrick</B>:<BR>
You 'cuse me wrong<BR>For injury I'se not done,<BR>
An' it won't be long<BR>'Fore I'll make you from me run.<BR>
I has dese bags o' luck, 'tis true,<BR>
So take care, gal, I'll send bad luck to you.<P>

<B>Remus</B>:<BR>
Shut up old man, enough you've said;<BR>
You can't fool Treemonisha -- she has a level head.<BR>
She is the only educated person of our race,<BR>
For many long miles far away from this place.<BR>
She'll break the spell of superstition in the neighborhood,<BR>
And all you foolish conjurors will have to be good.<BR>
To read and write she has taught me,<BR>And I am very grateful,<BR>
I have more sense now, you can see,<BR>And to her I'm very thankful.<BR>
You'd better quit your foolish ways<BR>And all this useless strife,<BR>
You'd better change your ways today<BR>And live a better life.<P>

<B>Zodzetrick</B>:<BR>
I don't care what you say,<BR>
I will never change my way.<BR>

<P>
<I>Starts to leave</I>
<P>

I'm going now, but I'll be back soon,<BR>
Long 'fore another new moon.<BR>
D'y'all hear?<P>

<B>Treemonisha and Remus</B>:<BR>
Yes, and we are glad you are going.<BR>

<P>
<I>They stand looking at Zodzetrick as he walks slowly away.</I>
<P>

Hope he'll stay away from here always, always.
