<H2>Act I Synopsis</H2>
Zodzetrick, an old "conjuror," tries to sell Monisha a <I>Bag of Luck</I>. Monisha's husband,
Ned, and daughter, Treemonisha, intervene and scold Zodzetrick for profiting from the
fears and superstitions of their neighbors. Remus tells Zodzetrick that his friend,
Treemonisha, being the only educated person in the area, will someday rid the
neighborhood of the conjurors' harmful influence.
<P>
As Zodzetrick leaves, a chorus of <I>Corn-Huskers</I> enters to begin work but, at
Treemonisha's suggestion, pause for a ring dance (<I>We're Goin' Around</I>).
<P>
As her neighbors start husking the corn, Treemonisha
notices that other girls are wearing wreaths made out of leaves and starts toward a
tree to harvest leaves for a <I>Wreath</I> of her own.  Monisha stops her, explaining that
it is a <I>Sacred Tree</I> because that is where she found Treemonisha as a baby, and where
Treemonisha played happily as a child. Treemonisha and the others are <I>Surprised</I> at the
news, and Monisha elaborates on <I>Treemonisha's Bringing Up</I>. Treemonisha is moved by
the story and, respecting Monisha's request, goes with Lucy into the woods to pick
leaves from another tree.
<P>
The local preacher, Parson Alltalk, arrives to deliver a
sermon filled with <I>Good Advice</I>. Lucy returns out of breath, telling her neighbors
that during the sermon, Zodzetrick and his partner, Luddud, kidnapped Treemonisha
and took her deep into the forest. Amid general <I>Confusion</I>, a group of men leave to
rescue Treemonisha and Remus follows, taking a scarecrow to wear as a costume to scare
the conjurors.
