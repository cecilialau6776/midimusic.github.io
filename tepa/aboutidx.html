<H2>About TEPA</H2>
<UL>
<LI>TEPA - Thorn and EMI Group Pensioners' Association was formed in March 1994, at a meeting attended by over 100
Company Pensioners at Feltham, Middlesex.
<P>
<LI>A Committee was elected to set up and organise the Association, with the primary objective of 'representing
the interests of all THORN EMI pensioners, both within the national community and directly with the Trustee Board
of the THORN EMI Pension Fund'. TEPA became Thorn and EMI Group Pensioners' Association, when the
Company demerged in 1996.
<P>
<LI>Today, TEPA has well over a thousand members spread throughout the UK and Europe, with major groups in
all the historical Company areas.
</UL>
<H3>Why You Need TEPA</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The growing trend towards early retirement means that many pensioners and their dependents will be reliant
on pension income for a very long time ahead. Fortunately, the record of our own pension schemes have
been generally satisfactory, but who can predict the long term effects of Government legislation or changes
in the Companies' circumstances in the future? Nomura, who recently acquired Thorn, have assured
members that the security of the Fund will not be affected. However, we must remain vigilant.
<P>
<LI>TEPA keeps you in touch with your fellow pensioners with annual meetings in Sunbury-on-Thames Middlesex
and Wells Somerset; also, publication three times a year of the TEPA 'Newsletter'.
<P>
<LI>TEPA is affiliated to the Occupational Pensioners' Alliance, OPA, which provides a link
with colleagues from other national and international companies.
<P>
<LI>There is also contact with other organisations concerned with the welfare of the retired, such as 'Help the Aged',
'Age Concern' and the 'Campaign for Pension Fund Democracy'.
<P>
<LI>TEPA believes that the 20 million members of occupational pension schemes need the additional protection
of the Law, however secure their own schemes may be, especially at a time of uncertain economic conditions
and company take-overs and when there could be changes in state pension provision. That is why TEPA was
actively promoting the pensioners' case with MPs and Ministers during the passage of the Pensions Act through
Parliament.
<P>
<LI>With many retired professionals in its ranks, TEPA maintains a high level of expertise on Pension matters and
a watching brief on new legislation and our own Pension Funds.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Why TEPA Needs You</H3>
<UL>
<LI>TEPA needs to recruit the ideas and energies of all those who have retired from the Thorn and EMI Group
of Companies. It can only speak effectively on your behalf with a strong, united voice and financial
independence.
<P>
<LI>It extends a special welcome to those who have recently retired or who are due to retire shortly. The changes
in the law introducing greater participation by pensioners and employees in the running of their pension scheme
requires a firm committment by the new generation of pensioners to share in this responsibility. TEPA needs
to continue and indeed accelerate the recruitment of members if it is to carry on with its critical work.
<P>
<LI><strong>Do you know a Thorn or EMI Group Pensioner who is not a member of TEPA, a relative, a friend or a
neighbour? If so, it could be in their best interest to bring the Thorn &amp; EMI Group Pensioners' Association
to their attention.</strong>
