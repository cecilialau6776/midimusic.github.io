<h3>1.0 Introduction</h3>
The number of bulletins issued since the first
volume of the music catalogue was published having
become cumbersome, it has been thought, for
the convenience of our customers, best to issue another
volume. This second volume is arranged
alphabetically by composers, with an index at the
back of the book, including prices of all rolls listed.
Biographical sketches not contained in Volume I
are included in these pages and the compositions
arranged since the last bulletin was printed, some
twenty-five in number, are included in this edition
and will not appear in bulletins.
<h3>2.0 CATALOGUE OF MUSIC VOLUME II</h3>
<h3>ALBERT, L.</h3>
<h4>448 Cherry</h4>
Here is a sparkling bit of melody which we have
put on a roll for dance purposes. It is entirely
satisfactory as a musical number also, but its
strongest appeal is to those who dance. It is
very popular as a one-step and is enjoying a
degree of popularity.
<h3>ANDREWS, Mark 1875-</h3>
This noted organist was born in Gainsborough. England
in 1875, and came to the Umted States in 19002,
since which time he has resided in Montclair, N. J.
He is one of the best-known organists in the New
York district, and as a composer stands high, having
published over one hwndred works, including two
sonatas for organ. He is organist at the First Congregational
Church, Montclair.
<h4>455 Venetian Idyl</h4>
This is in effect a delightful little barcarole or
boat song. It has the graceful rhythm of the
barcarole form and is charming in both melody
and harmony.
<h4>478 Serenade</h4>
"Serenade" is a very indefinite term as applied
to a musical composition. Therefore, like most
other titles, its principal use is as a means of
identification. No designation could add to, or
detract from, the innate beauty of this little
thing. As in all the work of this composer, this
serenade reveals a remarkable gift of melody,
and as the harmonic setting is highly appropriate,
the result could be nought but enjoyable.
It is a little gem.
<h3>ARENSKY, Anton Stepanovitch 1861-1906</h3>
This well-known Russian composer and pianist was
born at Novgorod, July 31, 1861, and died in a sanatorium
at Tarioki, Finland, February 26, 1906, after
a long illness. He was a pupil of Johanssen and
Rimsky-Korsakow and in, 1882 was appointed Professor
of Harmony and Composition at the Imperial
Conservatory at Moscow. In 1895 he became conductor
of the Imperial Court Choir at Petrograd.
Arensky's muse was lyrical rather than dramatic, and
his smller numbers for the piano are particularly
delightful. suggesting Tchaikowsky. His works include
operas and most of the larger forms. 
<h4>528 Romance</h4>
This is a fair sample of the lyric quality of this
composer. He was much at home in things
such as this-and what could be prettier! It is
melodious and poetic in the extreme. The
harmonies are characteristic of the Russian
school and need no further recommendation.
<h3>ATHERTON, F.</h3>
<h4>416 Reverie</h4>
It is fortunate that so many things originally
written for the piano are satisfactorily adaptable
to the organ. Verily, the true greatness of
the pipe organ is found in ability to do all things
well.
<p>
In the case of hand-playing this trait of the
organ is limited to the technical ability of the
performer. The roll, however, recognizes no
such limitations, and it seems to delight in the
perforrpance of the most startling technical
difficulties. All this, however, is by the way.
The present number is a fugitive conceit for the
piano which loses none of its charm as a result of
its adaptation to the organ, and will be a pleasure
to all who hear it.
<h3>BACH, Johann Sebastian</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>647 Fantasie and Fugue in G Minor</h4>
Of all the Bach fugues for organ, this is the 

greatest. It is known as the "Great G Minor." 

It is wonderful when first heard, and grows 

more wonderful with each successive hearing. 

It should be listened to with the greatest attention.
Its depths of beauty are not to be fathomed
by the casual listener. It must be studied, 

as is an antique work of art.
<p> 

The fantasie, which is really an introduction, is a 

gigantic recitative,-like the oration of a Cicero 

or Socrates. It is Bach with a free rein. Those 

who are accustomed to think of Bach as conventional
will do well to give particular attention to 

this fantasie.
<p> 

It serves its purpose well in preparing the mind 

for the wonderful fugue which follows. 

<h4>663 Gavotte, from the Sixth Violin Sonata</h4>
This is a very famous gavotte from the last of
Bach's six sonatas for the violin. What charming
dance music it is! It is as dignified as a
minuet, but much more sprightly and vivacious.
With the minuet it divides honors as the most
charming of the old dance forms. No finer
example of this fascinating form exists than this
one.
<h3>BAGLEY, E. E.</h3>
<h4>371 National Emblem March</h4>
This is a stirring march, which through sheer
merit has won its way into popular favor. The
organ does full justice to its martial swing, and
falls little short of the effect produced by a
military band.
<h3>BALL, Ernest R. 1878-</h3>
This composer-sometimes called the "American
Tosti"--was born in Cleveland, July 21, 1878. He
was educated at the Cleveland Conservatory, and has
written more real successes than any other American
composer. Some of his most popular hits were "Love
Me and the World Is Mine," "In the Garden of My
Heart," "A Little Bit of Heaven," "Mother Machree,"
etc.
<h4>558 Down the Trail to Home, Sweet Home</h4>
This is a very popular waltz song which we have
arranged on the roll for dance purposes. It
fulfills its mission ideally. 
<h3>BARON, Maurice</h3>
<h4>549 An Indian Legend</h4>
Here is a really charming number which has in
it enough of exotic flavor to justify the title.
Four seemingly indefinite measures introduce a
beautiful theme which flows along gracefully for
a few measures when the introductory measures
appear as a counterpoint to the main theme.
The middle part is in splendid contrast, and
rises to a stirring climax. The:first theme then
reappears with a delightful flute obligato, leaving
the last word for the solo violin.
<h3>BARTHELMY, R.</h3>
<h4>555 Caressing Butterfly</h4>
This is a very pretty ballad-like melody with
just enough accompaniment to support it.
There is ample opportunity for the use of various
solo stops, and this opportunity has not been
overlooked in the arrangement. It is the sort of
thing that sounds best when all is quiet and the
lights are dim, and when one is in a meditative
mood.
<h3>BARTLETT, Homer Newton 1845·1910</h3>
Homer N. Bartlett was one of the best-known and
ablest of American composers. He was born in Olive,
N. Y., December 28, 1845, and soon showed unmistakable
evidence of great musical talent. He studied
piano with S. B. Mills, Max Braun and others until
1861. He played the organ in a number of New
York churches, his last position as organist being at
the Madison Avenue Baptist Church, where he played
for thirty-one years. He died on April 2, 192O. In
every sense he was an American-made musician. He
left behind many published works of worth, which
include nearly all of the orthodox forms, and a goodly
number in manuscript which the public will be interested
in hearing. The latter include a three act opera,
"La Valliere:' an oratorio, "Samuel," and a symphonic
poem, "Apollo."
<h4>484 Meditation Serieuse</h4>
This is one of the best-known and most pretentious
of Bartlett's compositions for organ.
While it is a little reminiscent of Wagner, it is
nevertheless a delightfully original composition
and brimful of innate beauty. It contains some
very striking harmonic progressions, and is no
less interesting melodically. It reveals the sterling
musicianship of the composer, and is a
splendid composition in every sense.
<h3>BATISTE, Edouard</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>660 Larghetto in E flat</h4>
Batiste wrote many things such as this, and they
are all worthy a hearing. He had a wonderful
gift of melody which he always supported by
appropriate and attractive harmonies. Here we
have a simple and pretty theme voiced in the
first instance with a simple accompaniment.
On the second appearance of the theme, after a
short interlude, we find it treated with a florid
accompaniment. Here we find Batiste doing
the sort of thing he liked best to do. It is a
really delightful little thing and characteristic
of the composer.
<h3>BEETHOVEN, Ludwig van</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>387 Symphony No. 5 in C Minor Allegro con Brio-First Movement</h4>
Of all classic symphonies, this is the one which
is most often played. The first movement is famous
for the brevity of its first and principal
theme, which consists of the first four notes
heard-three short and a long one. What can
be said about this theme that is new!
The music lover is familiar with the various
theories concerning it, any or all of which are
correct or erroneous, according to point of view.
After all, what is the use of all the talk about
what music means! The very tune which would
provoke a feeling of sadness in one would move
another to mirth, and to still another be whimsical,
capricious, or bizarre.
Beethoven himself said of his Pastoral Symphony-his
only attempt at symphonic programme music-that it
was "rather an expression
of feeling than a picture." Incidentally he
failed to state what feeling it expressed.
This wonderful music has a story for all; let it tell it.
<h4>388 Symphony No.5 in C Minor Third (Scherzo) and Fourth (A1legro) Movements</h4>
To most people this Scherzo seems to open with
an interrogation-which meets with an immediate
reply. As though the answer were unsatisfactory,
the query is repeated but meets with
the same response.
<p>
Then begins one of the most charming musical
conversations extant. What it is about must
be left to the listener. One may find much of
interest concerning this Symphony and others
in Philip H. Goepp's work, "Symphonies and
Their Meaning," to which sterling work we
would recommend all who are interested in
musical matters.
<p>
The present roll contains also the Finale of the
Symphony, giving it without pause as was the
intention of the composer.
<p> 

The last movement is an exultant march of 

gigantic proportions, interrupted by a short 

reference to the Scherzo, after which the March 

theme again takes the reins. At the close of the 

movement, the pace quickens into a Presto and 

the triumphant conclusion is at hand. 

<h4>400 Symphony No.6, Op.68 (Pastoral)</h4>
The Pastoral Symphony was written in the
wooded meadows near Vienna in the summer of
1808. Beethoven's inscription on the score may
be translated as follows, "The pleasant, cheerful
feelings which arise in man on arriving in
the country." He also adds that it is more an
expression of feeling than a painting.
There is, in the British Museum, a book of
sketches concerning this Symphony in Beethoven's
own hand, and in them he says that "The 

hearer is to be allowed to find out the situations 

for himself."
<p>
This would seem to indicate that Beethoven was 

very skeptical as to the power of music to engender
definite impressions, a fact in keeping 

with his general good sense with regard to music 

matters. The music is delightful and satisfying,
and it matters little what it means. 

<h4>411 Scherzo-Andante Scherzoso from String Quartette" Op. 18, No.4</h4>
Here is Beethoven in a playful humor! To 

many this statement may seem incompatible 

with the generally accepted idea of Beethoven's 

character. As a matter of fact, Beethoven had 

a sense of humor such as was possessed by few 

of the great composers.
<p> 

He was, perhaps, excelled in this particular by 

no one except Haydn. Surely he needed something
to balance the serious side of his life. 

This number is one of the brightest gems of 

musical composition. It has definite form; 

melody in profusion; and harmonies so simple, 

quaint and appropriate as to give the impression
that no other harmonies could be possible.
It is one of the most spontaneous, effervescent
and exuberant examples of writing extant.
<h4>412 Allegro from String Quartette, Op. 18, No.5</h4>
The combination of two violins, viola and 'cello
has furnished a vehicle for the sublimest inspirations
of most of the classical composers. The
form, as we know it, was originated by Haydn,
and is nothing more nor less than the sonata or
symphony form applied to four-part writing.
The early quartettes of Haydn were feeble and
immature things, but the child of Haydn's mind
grew to manhood and he ,left many quartettes
which are today'standards. Mozart bridged the
gap to Beethoven and left behind him twentysix
immortal quartettes.
<p>
Beethoven, unlike some of the others, seemed to
experience no handicap in having to write for
only four fiddles, instead of a full orchestra, and
his quartettes are just as symphonic as though
they had been called sympnonies, the only difference
being that in one case he wrote a
symphony for a quartette of strings, and in the
other for a full orchestra.
<p>
The present roll is the first movement of the
celebrated quartette in A major, and is an
example of Beethoven in his cheeriest mood. It
is full of interesting dialogue, and there is not a
dull moment in it.
<h4>427 Allegro ma non tanto, Op. 18, No. 4</h4>
The Number 4 Quartette is perhaps the best
known of the six contained in Opus 18, and indeed
is a general favorite among the earlier
quartettes. While the present movement is
purely orthodox from a Beethoven point of
view, being in the sonata form invented by
Beethoven and used by him and all other composers
since, it is not so elaborate as many of the
later opera in quartette form. It is no less
charming, howev~r, on account of its comparative
simplicity.
<h4>Adagio from Moonlight Sonata, Op. 27, No.2</h4>
Beethoven did nothing in the way of piano compositions
that is more widely known or more
passionately loved than the so-called Moonlight
Sonata. Nothing could be more beautiful than
the plaintive, soul-stirring theme of this movement.
<p>
The silly name which it bears is derived from a
criticism of the sonata by Rellstab which mentioned
the moonlight on the Lake of Lucerne.
It might just as appropriately bear any other
title. It is a work of superlative beauty and
needs no sobriquet to arouse interest or stimulate
imagination.
<h4>485 Minuetto, Op. 18, No. 4</h4>
What more need be said of this roll than that
it is taken from a Beethoven string quartette?
Such a minuet could not have been written by
anyone else. Beethoven was always Beethoven!
His earliest compositions resembled those of
no other composer except in form. His remarkable
naivete and ingenuousness were his chief
characteristics through life. Any movement
from a Beethoven quartette is a "thing of
beauty and a joy forever."
<h4>526 Allegretto alia Polacca</h4>
This is not only "like a Polacca" but it is a Polacca.
It is from the delightful Serenade, Op. 8,
for Violin, Viola and Violoncello. This whole
trio bears the stamp of youthful enthusiasm and
is one of the most fascinating things Beethoven
did in early life. That Beethoven liked it in his
after years-although he cared little for his
early work-is proven by the fact that he arranged
this serenade for piano and violin and
called it Notturno, Op. 42. Beethoven's facility
in writing for a limited number of instruments
was never better shown than in this, the daintiest
of things. There is no adjective which adequately
defines it,-it must be heard.
<h4>588 Larghetto from Second Symphony</h4>
It is readily discovered by students of Beethoven
that his music may be divided into periods.
That is to say, certain characteristics are present
in many of his works which seem to place them
naturally into a group. Nothing was too good
for Beethoven, and he very wisely began his
career as a composer with Haydn and Mozart
as his models. They represented the best in
music, and it was natural that the youthful
genius of Beethoven should aim high.
<p>
Before long, however, he felt a certain restraint
in the use of the strict forms employed by
Haydn and Mozart, and he began to leave the
beaten path and start out for himself, refusing
to be dictated to by anybody or anything except
that rare thing within him which we call 
genius. The noted student and writer, Herr
von Lenz, places the Second Symphony, Op. 36,
in the first period, and, singularly enough, be
places Op. 26, Op. 27 and Op. 31-which were
written at least a year earlier than Op. 36-in
the second period. It is evident, therefore, that
chronology plays little part in the arrangement
of the learned writer. It would seem that Beethoven
at times felt a little strange and lonely
while exploring, and returned temporarily to
the familiar paths of the past. But it was only
temporary, for his progress was inevitable.
<p>
The Larghetto from the Second Symphony is
as strongly characteristic of Beethoven as anything
he did later in life. It may lack some of
the finesse of his later works, but the divine
spark illumines it from beginning to end. It is
superlatively beautiful.
<h4>557 Scherzo from Second Symphony</h4>
This Scherzo is in the form invented by Beethoven,
and used by him in most of his symphonies.
It is a youthful Beethoven that speaks,
but it is as characteristic of him as anything
achieved later in life. No one else could have
done it.
<h4>575 Adagio Molto, from First Symphony</h4>
This is the first movement of Beethoven's First
Symphony. Aside from its native beauty and
great musical worth, it is interesting to note how
thoroughly characteristic of the mature Beethoven
it is. It is a perfectly easy matter to
place the works of Beethoven into periods, and
it has been done. In other words, his progress
in the technique of composition is not only discoverable,
but obvious. He was a master from
the beginning. His works are individual to a
greater extent than those of any other composer.
Anyone familiar with his works would
easily discover, upon hearing this first symphony,
the composer of the ninth, or of any of
the others. The touch of the master is ever
present. This movement is much less involved
than some of the later works, but is just as
charming as anything can be.
<h4>579 Allegretto, Second Movement, Seventh Symphony</h4>
The Seventh Symphony has been called the
"Poem of Earth and Humanity"-a rather
high-sounding title, but perhaps as good as any
-certain as it is that it is Beethoven in a rare
vein. The first theme is dirgelike. in its rhythm
and harmonies. The second melody is in the
major and abandons the solemn vein. It is a
lyrical gem. Both themes seem strangely
prophetic of Schubert. A period of contrapuntal
and fugal development brings on again
the mournful first theme which sings itself to a
peaceful end, and with the end of this allegretto
comes the end of one of the greatest compositions
in music literature.
<h4>588 Gavotte in F Major</h4>
We have put this little piece on the organ as
much for its historical interest as for any other
reason. It lacks none of the essentials of a fine
gavotte, but its greatest interest lies in the fact
that it is a recently discovered effort of Beethoven's
youth-sixteen years of age. We give
the history of it, quoting Harold Bauer:
"The present edition of an unpublished gavotte
by Beethoven is due to investigations made in
1908 by Messrs. Georges de St. Foix and
Theodore de Wyzewa with the object of establishing
the authenticity of certain autograph
manuscripts heretofore attributed to Mozart.
"These manuscripts, originally in the possession
of the Emperor of Austria, were presented by
him, oddly enough, to no less a person than
the Sultan Abdul-Aziz of Turkey, who subsequently
gave them to his music director, Guatelli
Pasha. The well-known English collector,
Julian Marshall, bought them from Guatelli's
son and they were ultimately acquired by the
British Museum.
<p>
"A close examination of these manuscripts resulted
in the startling conclusion that not only
had a serious error been committed in attributing
them to Mozart, but that the idiosyncrasies
of style and handwriting proved beyond the possibility
of doubt that they could have emanated
from no other pen than that of Beethoven.
<p>
"This charming gavotte, which represents Beethoven
in his earliest and consequently most
Mozartian period (about 1786), was played for
the first time by Mme. Olga Samaroff and the
editor at a concert given by the Beethoven Association
on January 13, 1920, in New York."
<h4>631 Tempo Ordinario d' un Minuetto</h4>
This is an adaptation of the wonderful minuet
from the Serenade for Flute, Violin, and Viola,
Op. 25. No other composer ever approached
Beethoven in his ability to write for a small 
number of instruments. In this line he had no
competitor. This minuet is rather unique in
form in that it has two trios, after each of which
the first two strains are played. Itis Beethoven
at his best. Nothing more daintily beautiful
was ever conceived.
<h4>641 Adagio Cantabile from Septet, Op.20</h4>
We have from time to time remarked in these
pages that nothing could be more exquisite than
a Beethoven slow movement. That assertion
still stands, and we now offer more evidence as
to its truthfulness.
<p>
This famous composition, which is nothing more
nor less than a symphony for seven instruments,
was written for violin, viola, 'cello, double bass,
clarinet, bassoon and horn, and dedicated to the
Empress Maria Theresa. In the organ adaptation
we have given strict attention to the original
scoring, with the result that the arrangement
lacks little, if any, of the charm due to the unique
selection of instruments for which it was written.
It is a most exquisite composition faithfully
given by the roll.
<h4>722 Sonata Pathetique, First Movement</h4>
Here we have a movement from one of Beethoven's
early sonatas which lends itself to organ
adaptation in a manner which will surprise those
who believe (or pretend to so believe) that piano
music should be performed on the piano only.
One only has to hear the wonderful introduction
to realize that the piano never could equal the
organ in this particular thing. The title
"Pathetique" is extremely apt. The main body
of this movement is quite equal to the introduction
in effectiveness.
<h4>733 Coriolanus Overture</h4>
Of all the overtures of Beethoven this one to
Coriolanus, a tragedy by Colin, is perhaps the
most popular.
<p>
It is certainly as beautiful as any, and by many
thought to be Beethoven's best work in the
overture form. It was written in 1807. He
was quite as much at home in the overture form
as in the symphony form, and his marvelous
gift of melody, coupled with his wonderful
technique of composition, are just as apparent
here as in the symphony.
<h4>736 Prometheus Overture</h4>
"The Men of Prometheus" is the title of the
ballet of which this is the overture. This overture
and seventeen other numbers comprise the
only ballet that Beethoven wrote. The overture
alone lives by virtue of its value as a concert
number. The entire ballet was performed in
1801 in Vienna, but little if any of the music is
now known except the wonderfully brilliant
overture, which we have very effectively arranged
for the organ, from the orchestral score.
<h4>740 Leonore Overture, No.3</h4>
It is very well known that Beethoven wrote
but one opera. The libretto was adapted by
Joseph Sonnliethner from Bouilly's "Leonore
or l'Amour conjugal." He received the text in
the winter of 1804, and composed the opera at
Hetzendorf in the summer.
<p>
The thing that is of particular interest in connection
with this overture is that he wrote four
overtures to his only opera.
<p>
The opera was first produced at Vienna, on
November 20, 1805, and the overture used was
the one now known as Leonore Overture, No.2.
The libretto was then reduced to two acts, and
three numbers taken from the opera. The above
overture, Leonore No.8, was then composed.
<p>
After the death of the Italian director of the
opera at Prague, and the adoption of German
opera there, Beethoven, in the hope of having
his opera performed by Liebich, the new director,
wrote what we know as Leonore No.1.
<p>
The performance, however, did not take place
and the No. 1 Overture remained in manuscript
until after Beethoven's death.
<p>
The No. 8 Overture is widely known as a concert
number and is a very great favorite.
<h4>742 Egmont Overture</h4>
Beethoven composed this overture for the drama
by Goethe. It is supposed by some commentators
to express the plot of the drama in music.
Beethoven did little in the way of programme
music; his best-known effort being the Pastoral
Symphony, of which he said it was "more an
expression of feeling than of painting." It is
doubtful if the overture is intended to more
than depict certain moods.
<p>
All of this, however, has nothing whatever to do
with the musical worth of this masterpiece. It
needs no programme. It is well able to stand as
a gorgeous composition and needs the support
of no plot, or other extraneous element.
<h3>BERLIN, Irving</h3>
Born in Russia, this composer of popular music came
to America in youth and began composing some of the
lighter pieces. His first hit--one of the first ragtime
songs-was "Alexander's Ragtime Band." He also
composed "Everybody's Doing It" and many other
popular songs.
<h4>559 Tell Me, Little Gypsy</h4>
This is the song hit of Ziegfeld Follies of 1920.
It is arranged as a fox trot, in which form it is
tremendously popular.
<h3>BERLIOZ, Hector 1803-1869</h3>
Berlioz was born at La-Cote-St.-Andre, near Grenoble,
on December 11, 1803. He was the son, of a
country doctor who educated him for the practice of
medicine. We have intimated somewhere in these
paragraphs that a boy who was predestined to become
a musician would overcome any obstacles which were
thrown in his way. The case of Berlioz is additional
proof of our point.
<p>
The most impressionable years of his life were wasted
in the perfunctory study of a profession toward which
(to use his own phrase) he felt nothing better than a
"cold disgust," He finaUy decided upon a musical
career and burned all bridges behind him. His allowance
from home was cut off and he found himself in
such extreme poverty that he was compelled to maintain
himself by singing in a chorus at one of the small
theatres.
<p>
He was admitted as a pupil at the Conservatoire, and
made marvelously rapid progress. He is said to have
lost much, however, by his intractability. He jumped
at conclusions and had little respect for, or paticnce
with, academic methods. After years of disappointment,
he won the Prix de Rome with his cantata, "La
Mort de Sardanapole."
<p>
The terms of the Prix de Rome imposed three years of
travel-the first two to be spent in Italy. He could
not bear expatriation, however, and after eighteen
months he petitioned the Ministry to allow him to return
to Paris, Between 1837 and 1840 he began to
receive recognition. The French Government commissioned
him to write a requicm and paid him a fee
of four thousand francs. In 1834 Paganini paid him
twenty thousand francs for "Harold en Italie." In
1840 he received ten thousand francs for the "Symphonic
Funebre et Triomphale;"
<p>
Most of his works are in the larger forms, consisting
of cantatas, oratorios, symphonies, etc. Among his
literary works, one will hold its place at the top for all
time: his work on orchestration.
<h4>600 Rakoczy March from the Damnation of Faust</h4>
Many are the beliefs as to the origin of this
march, made famous by Berlioz. Its composition
has been attributed to an Austrian prince, 
Rakoczy Ferencz, early in the seventeenth century.
By others it is supposed to have been
composed by Michael Barna, court violinist to
Prince Franz Rakoczy, the second.
<p>
In any event, it was handed down by the gypsies
and Hungarians and put to paper by Carl
Vaczek.
<p>
Berlioz orchestrated it and used it in his
"Damnation of Faust," and, believing in the
eternal fitness of things, transferred the first
scene of the work to Hungary.
<h3>BERNARD, Felix, and BLACK, Johnny S.</h3>
<h4>452 Dardanella</h4>
It is probable that no example of popular writing
has created such a furore as this one in the
same length of time. It is being whistled, sung
and danced by everybody. It is simply impossible
to get away from it. We have produced it
on a roll for dance purposes, and fox-trotting
to its captivating rhythm will be found an enjoyable
pastime.
<h3>BIGGS. Richard Keys 1886-</h3>
This well-known organist was born at Glendale, Ohio,
September 16, 1886. He was educated at the University
of Michigan, studied music at the Cincinnati College
of Music ard in London. His activities, as
organist of one of the large Brooklyn churches, were
interrupted by the war. After receiving his discharge
he returned to Brooklyn and resumed the practice of
his profession. He has made a number of organ
arrangements of operatic and piano compositions, and
a few of his original compositions have been published.
<h4>608 Sunset Meditation</h4>
It is unostentatious, and beautiful in its simplicity-a
pretty melody, delightfully clothed
with the simplest harmonies.
<h3>BIZET, Georges</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>397 L'Arlesienne, First Suite for Orchestra. Minuetto</h4>
The play for which the music was written was a
failure from the first. Bizet, seeming to realize
that it was the text, rather than the music, which
was responsible for the failure, resolved to put
to use some of the good music and selected some
of the best of the numbers, from which he made
two orchestral suites. The First Suite especially
has become a great favorite at orchestra concerts.
The present minuet is one of much grace
and charm, and is delightfully given by the organ.
<h4>409 Farandole from L'Arlesienne</h4>
This is one of the numbers rescued from the ill fated
play by Daudet, for which Bizet composed
the music. As is well known, after the
failure of the play, Bizet got together a few of
the best musical numbers and made them into
two suites. The present number is from the first.
<p>
Little is known as to the origin of the Farandole,
and one cannot do better for a description of it
than to turn to "Grove's Dictionary," from
which we quote the following:
<p>
"The Farandole consists of a long string of young
men and women, sometimes as many as a hundred in
number, holding one another by the hands, or by ribbons
or handkerchiefs. The leader is always a bachelor,
and he is preceded by one or more musicians playing
the galoubet, i.e., a small wooden flute-a-bec, and
the tambourin. With his left hand the leader holds
the hand of his partner, in his right he waves a flag,
handkerchief, or ribbon, which serves as a signal for
his followers. As the Farandole proceeds through 
the streets of the town, the string of dancers is constantly
recruited by fresh additions. The leader (to
quote the poet Mistral) 'makes it come and go, turn
backwards and forwards-sometimes he forms it into
a ring, sometimes winds it in a spiral, then he breaks
off from his followers and dances in front, then he
joins on again, and makes it pass rapidly under the
uplifted arms of the last couple.'"
<p>
The Farandole is usually danced at all the great
feasts in the towns of Provence, such as the
feast of Corpus Domini, or the "Coursos de la
Tarasque," which were founded by King Rene
on April 14, 1474, and take place at Tarascon
annually, on July 29. In the latter the Farandole
is preceded by the huge effigy.of a legendary
monster-the Tarasque-borne by several
men and attended by the gaily dressed chevaliers
de la Tarasque.
<h4>718 Adagietto, Le Carillon, from First L'Arlesienne Suite, No.1</h4>
We have already stated in connection with the
Minuet from this Suite (No. 397), that the
play for which this music was written was a
failure. It is fortunate that Bizet realized the
value of the music and arranged various numbers
into the two suites which are known so well. 
Otherwise we should have been deprived of
some beautiful music.
<p>
Philip Hale, the well-known critic, says of the
Adagietto, "I know of nothing in dramatic
music that approaches this adagio, which not
only accentuates the Biblical sublimity of the
text, but rises to a height of pathos beyond the
reach of word or gesture."
<p>
The Carillon depicts the gaiety of the betrothal
of Frederi and Vivette and the festival of Saint Eloi.
The three incessantly recurring notes
represent bells. The andantino, the middle
part, is the entrance of Mere Renaud, one of
the characters in the play. After this, the Carillon
proceeds to a brilliant end.
<h4>616 Le Retour (The Return)</h4>
Bizet is, of course, chiefly known for his opera
"Carmen." His "Pearl Fishers" is fairly well
known also, as is his Arlesienne Suite. A
simple song without words from his pen, however,
is something hardly to be expected. Here
it is, though, and it is a lovely thing. The orchestras
in some of the large "movie" theatres
have recently discovered its beauty and play it
often. It is likely, therefore, to be recognized
by many who have wondered what it was. The
secret is now out, as a result of this effective roll. 
<h3>BLAUFUSS, Walter</h3>
<h4>453 My Isle of Golden Dreams</h4>
This is a dreamy, quiet waltz which is immensely
popular. It is being played in theatres at times
when soft music is necessary, and is a great
favorite for dance purposes.
BOELLMANN, Leon 1862-1897</h3>
This famoult organist and composer was born in
Ensisheim. Alsace, September 25, 1862, and died in
Paris, October 11, 1897. He was a pupil of Gigout
at the Niedermeyer School. He has written in almost
every form, and was known far and wide for his wonderful
organ playing. His compositions are graceful
and pure in style, showing remarkable knowledge of
form and facility of technique.
<h4>392 Minuet Gothique (Suite Gothique)</h4>
The suite, of which this graceful minuet is a
part, was dedicated to William C. Carl, the
well-known American organist.
<p>
It is a composition of much merit, and has attained
a degree of popular favor which has required
all concert organists to include it in their
repertoire.
<p>
The suite contains besides the minuet, three
numbers, "Choral," "Priere a Notre-Dame,"
and "Toccata." 
<h4>645 Fantasie Dialogue</h4>
This delightful composition was originally written
for organ and orchestra, but was subsequently
arranged by the composer for the organ 

alone. It is the latter form that we have used 

in the roll.
<p>

A happy choice of thematic material and consummate
skill in the development of it, are characteristic
of Boellmann, and this combination is 

to be found in this roll. More need not be said 

in praise of it. 

<h3>BOROWSKI, Felix 1872-</h3>
This composer and critic was born in Westmoreland,
England, March 10 1872. He was educated privately,
studied violin and piano with private teachers
in London and at the Cologne Conservatoire, his
teacher in composition being Gustave Jensen. For
many years he has been active in musical matters in
Chicago, as critic, teacher, lecturer and composer.
His works include two suites for orchestra, two pieces
for string orchestra, two sonatas and a suite for
organ, a sonata and about sixty pieces for piano,
many vioUn solos and about fifteen songs.
<p>
He possesses a wonderful gift of melody, and his works
all show the hand of the skilled workman. 
<h4>492 Chanson de Mai</h4> 

This "Song of May" is a very beautiful thing. 

It has as graceful a theme as could be desired 

and the thematic material is treated in a masterful
manner. It is a pleasure to find a critic who 

can do things other than to find fault. Borowski
is unique in this respect, and has in this 

composition given us a charming little work. 

<h4>527 Reverie</h4>
A dreamy melody, a thing full of repose is this
from beginning to end. Slippers, a cigar, an
easy chair, quiet and such a tune are all a tired
man could ask.
<h4>603 Priere</h4>
Felix Borowski is a musician and composer of
exceptional ability. He never writes below a
very high level which he seems to have set for
himself. He has done some big things-a
sonata and suite for organ, for instance, both of
which we hope sometime to put on a roll for
the edification of Estey Organ owners. At this
time we are especially concerned with this
smaller number, "Priere." It is a beautiful
work full of real devotional feeling and strikingly
original. 
<h3>BRAHMS, Johannes</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>659 Allegro</h4>
There is never any discussion nowadays about
the quality of Brahms' symphonies. They are
the work of a genius-the last of a long line of
German 	geniuses of which Bach was the first.
There is, however, a wide difference of opinion
as to the quality of that elusive ingredient of
the symphonic formula which entrances the
listener and holds his interest unfalteringly.
To the student, Brahms presents a different
problem. To him, Brahms is like an unexplored
country-new and novel beauties everywhere.
Structurally, the four symphonies are
gigantic masterpieces, and there is little in
music which will pay equal dividends on genuine study.
<p>
One of these symphonies-the second-permits
of no argument on any score. It is gorgeous
from beginning to end.
<p>
For the present roll, we have chosen the first
movement. We are confident that a better
choice could not have been made. To quote
Othello, it "will sing the savageness out of a
bear." 
<h4>714 Allegro con Spirito, Finale of Second Symphony</h4>
The Second Symphony is the great favorite of
all the Brahms symphonies, four in number.
The reason is not difficult to find: it is tuneful
and splendid in form. This constituent, form,
is the greatest single element in the writing of
a symphony. It would be possible to write an
atrocious theme and give it the necessary treatment
to make of it a symphony, but such a thing
would not be beautiful. It is form which relates
architecture to music. Form cannot make a
beautiful thing out of inappropriate materials it
is only when we have proper thematic material,
the design of an artist, and the artisanship
of a master that such things as this symphony
are produced.
<h3>BREAU, Louis, and COOPER, Joe
<h4>718 I Want My Mammy, introducing "Just a Little Love Song"</h4>
We have given here the very popular fox trot,
"I Want My Mammy," and have introduced
the chorus of "Just a Little Love Song." Such
an arrangement has proved to be very popular
for dance purposes. 
<h3>BREWER, John Hyatt</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>678 An Autumn Sketch</h4>
This is a most dainty little caprice written for
the organ. It is a seductively tuneful thing,
full of all the traits necessary to the making
of a caprice. As we have it on the roll, it is
most enjoyable.
<h3>BRUCH, Max 1838-</h3>
Perhaps the most eminent of living German composers
is Max Bruch, who was born at Cologne, January 6,
1838. His mother was a distinguished singer, and she
carefully watched the development of her son's musical
talents. He gave extraordinary promise in composition
during his studies with Breidenstein at Bonn, and
in 1852 gained a scholarship of the Mozart foundation
at Frankfort-on-Main for four years, continuing
his studies under Heller, Reinecke and Breuning
at Cologne. From 1858 to 1861 he taught in his
native town, and in 1858 gave there his first work, an
operetta, "Scherz, List und Rache."
<p>
His works number about ninety, including all forms,
with cantatas and vocal works in the majority. 
<h4>628 Adagio from Violin Concerto, Op.26</h4>
For many years the Bruch Concerto has been
the standard by which aspiring violinists have
been measured. Its requirements are very
great-not so much from a standpoint of technique,
but rather from that of tone and breadth
of musical feeling. A mere technician could
only play the notes. Nothing short of a genuine
musician can bring out its true beauty. We
know of nothing more beautiful than this
Adagio, and in its adaptation to the organ it has
lost nothing.
<h3>BULL, Ole Bornemann 1810-1880</h3>
One of the most picturesque figures in the history of
music was the subject of this paragraph. He was the
son of a physician in Bergen who looked with little
favor upon music as a vocation, and therefore sent
him to the University of Christiania to study theology.
In a very short time he was made conductor of a
musical society of that town. He left Norway very
suddenly in 1829-perhaps as a result of some part
he may have taken in the political feeling rampant at
that time. He suffered many hardships during the
next two years, and finally got to Paris, where he
heard Paganini, whose playing had the effect of making
him settle down to vigorous study of the technique
of the violin. His reduced circumstances and necessary
privation brought upon him severe illness and
despondency. Fortunately a benevolent Parisian lady
took a motherly interest in him at this time, and
nursed him back to health-this lady's daughter later
becoming hia wife. After his recovery he made his
first Paris appearance. His success was from that
time asaured, and he created nothing short of a furore
in Italy. He played in all parts of the world to the
delight of all who heard him, except a certain few who
accused him of charlatanism.
<p>
The fact is, that he was extremely eccentric, but was
nevertheless an extraordinarily capable performer
who had a lot of tricks and a technique which was
probably surpassed by no one but Paganini.
<p>
He seldom played any but his own compositions, but
he could find little else to give scope to hia marvelous
technique.
<h4>394 Alpine Maid's Sunday</h4>
Someone may have written a more delicious
melody than this one, but if so, it is unknown
to us. The melodies which will endure the test
of standing absolutely alone-without harmonies-are
few. This is one. The harmony with
which this gem is clothed was supplied by
Svendsen. and could not be surpassed for
beauty, but nothing in the way of a setting
could add a whit to the exquisiteness of the unadorned
beauty of this melody. 
<h3>CESEK, H. A.</h3>
<h4>598 Twilight</h4>
This is a very attractive melody of the sort
which, while written for the piano, fits the organ
as though made to order. We have used a flute
to voice the first part, while the second part is
played on a violin. On the repetition of the first
theme, one of the wood winds sings the melody,
giving way to the flute in a pretty little coda.
<h3>CHAFFIN, Lucien Gates 1846-</h3>
Lucien Gates Chaffin was born at Worcester, Mass.,
March 23, 1846, received his A.B. from Brown University,
1867. He is an educator of note, and was
a concert organiat for many years, also a critic and
lecturer on music. His compositions are comparatively
few, but of very high order of excellence.
<h4>498 In Springtime</h4>
"The heart is young in Springtime.<br>
Birds sing their merriest notes." Old Poem.
<p>
Here is a gorgeous little piece which is full of
merry notes. In form it is like many other
compositions in this style of organ music, but
here the resemblance ceases, for it is better
far better than the average. The middle part is
a sort of bird song cadenza, after which the
unadorned first theme is used for a close.
<h4>568 Wedding Chimes</h4>
Chaffin is a man who has written comparatively
little that has been published. Judging
from his published works, he is an exacting critic
so far as his own works are concerned. Nothing
trivial or commonplace has come from his pen.
"Wedding Chimes" is a good example of a very
high type of organ music. The title is rather
misleading, as the chimes do not appear in it.
The figure in the bass in the last few measures
is distinctly a chime figure and it is this which
really justifies the title.
<h3>CHAMINADE, Cecile</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>475 Pierrette, Air de Ballet, No.5</h4>
This is one of the dainty little things that Chaminade
writes so well for the piano. Like most
of her work in this vein it lacks definite form but
has a sprightly charm all its own and is distinctly
characteristic of her. It has been put on
the roll for the organ; and in the process has lost
none of its beauty. In fact, it is more interesting
because of the added tonal variety.
<h4>594 Serenade</h4>
The conspicuous characteristic of Chaminade's
compositions is grace. They are never big in
conception, but are invariably full of charm.
Indeed, in most instances they are faultless
miniatures which evince the greatest care in
matters of detail and which withstand the closest
and most exacting scrutiny. Such attention
to detail often produces a perfect but far from
interesting result. Not so with Chaminade!
Her work always possesses the innate charm
which is the result of a fine poetic temperament.
This serenade is no exception to the rule. It
is a most bewitching little thing.
<h4>720 La Lisonjera (The Flatterer)</h4>
We have adapted a few of Chaminade's charming
piano pieces to the organ, and without exception
they have been enthusiastically received.
They have all gained rather than lost by being
fitted to the organ. This graceful number is no
exception. It is too well known to require a
description and, being from Chaminade's pen,
it needs no recommendation. 
<h3>CHOPIN, Frederic Francois</h3>
( For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>393 Nocturne in E flat, Op. 9, No.2</h4>
This is the most popular of all Chopin nocturnes,
and deservedly so. It sings itself into
one's soul, and while it is much abused, its claim
to precedence as a lovely melody is not apt to
be seriously disputed. One is likely to be surprised
at the organ rendition as given by the
present roll. It fits the organ as though made
for it.
<h4>421 Nocturne, Op. 55, No. 1</h4>
This familiar Nocturne needs little comment.
It is very characteristic and while by no means
morbid, has a tinge of sadness in it which is unmistakable.
Much has been written about the
effect of Chopin's music, and no man ever
created such violent contrasts of opinion. His
adherents exhausted their supply of adjectives
in his praise, while others, including just as capable
critics, were relentless in their abuse of him.
In the event of such differences of opinion, one
must judge for one's self what is good. Chopin
was trivial at times but never commonplace. No
one can deny that this nocturne is a pretty tune,
and one which grows in favor on acquaintance
<h4>432 Polonaise (Military)</h4>
The precursor of this stately Polish dance is
supposed by some to have been an ancient
Christmas carol. This theory is supported by
the fact that in former times singing accompanied
the dance. The earliest polonaises extant,
however, are purely instrumental, to which fact
is due the more generally accepted belief that
the dance-as known to us at least-is of courtly
origin, and, according to Grove, came about as
follows:
<p>
"In 1573, Henry III of Anjou was elected to
the Polish throne, and in the following year held
a great reception at Cracow, at which the wives
of the nobles marched in procession past the
throne to the sound of stately music. It is said
that after this, whenever a foreign prince was
elected to the crown of Poland, the same ceremony
was repeated, and that out of it the polonaise
was gradually developed as the opening
dance at court festivities."
<p> 

Bach, Handel, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, 

and even Wagner wrote polonaises. It remained
for a native son to develop the national 

dance to its absolute perfection. Before Chopin, 

it was dry and uninteresting; he imbued it with 

new life and spirit, as the present roll will 

testify. 

<h3>COERNE, Louis Adolphe 1870-</h3>
Born in Newark, N.J. February 27, 1870. Was educated
in German and French schools. Graduated from
Boston Latin School in 1888, and Harvard College in
1890. Received the first Ph.D. given by Harvard for
musical work, for his thesis on the Evolution of Modern
Orchestration. He studied composition with J. K.
Paine, violin with Franz Kneisel, organ and composition
with Rheinberger at the Royal Academy, Munich,
from which school he graduated with honors in 1893.
He has led a very active musical life-teaching and
composing. His compositions include a symphonic
poem, "Hiawatha," and two operas, one of which.
"Zenobia," was the first opera by a native of the
United States to be performed in Europe. It was
performed in Bremen, Germany, during the season of
1905-1906. In addition to these are many smaller
works in the usual forms.
<h4>490 The River of Life</h4>
This is a delightfully unpretentious little number
by a man capable of big things. One of the
unmistakable evidences of a big man is his ability
to do the little things well, and keep them
from being commonplace. It has a theme of
unusual beauty, and a middle part which is in
marked contrast. The first theme reappears
and a short coda effects an appropriate close. 
<h4>504 Consecration</h4>
This is one of a number of little things written
by this composer for the organ. It is a delightful
bit of writing and it reveals to the discerning
the musicianship of the composer.
<h3>COHAN, George M. 1878-</h3>
This composer of popular songs made his bow to the
public as an actor as a member of "The Four Cohans."
He has written many successful sketches for vaudeville
and about eighteen plays. His musical ability
is represented by a hundred or more poptilar songs.
<h4>373 Over There</h4>
This is one of the most popular songs inspired
by the war. It has a good swing, and a splendid
war-time quality which is likely to insure its
popularity for some time to come.
<h3>CUI, Cesar Antonovich 1835-</h3>
Thi, famous composer was born at Vilna, January
18, 1835. He is the son of a French officer who, being
unable to follow the retreat from Moscow in 1812, 
remained in Poland, and married a Lithuanian lady,
and became professor in French at the high school at
Vilna.
<p>
Cui received a good preparatory education, and
eventually entered the School of Military Engineering
at St. Petersburg. being appointed to a professorship
after he graduated. He became a recognised authority
on fortification, holding the rank of Lieutenant-General
of Engineers, and has lectured and written much
on the subject.
<p>
Having laid aside his musical tastes during the acquirement
of his military education, he succumbed to
his first love after he had become a full-fledged officer.
His contact with Balakirev had much to do with his
musical enthusiasm. He married a gifted pupil of
Dargomijski, Mlle. Bamberg, and from that time became
very active in composition. Eight operatic
works, over two hundred songs, very many pieces for
piano, strings, orchestra, and many choruses are the
evidence of an etrtremely industrious musical life.
Cui's work is characterized by grace and refined
lyricism. It is seldom tragic.
<h4>547 Orientale</h4>
No one ever wrote miniatures such as this any
better than Cui. He was known as a miniaturist,
and this one example would seem to establish
the claim. It smacks of the Orient, surely,
and is as charming a little thing as could be
found. 
<h3>CZIBULKA, Alphons 1842-1894</h3>
Born at Szepesvavallya, Hungary, on May 14, 1842.
He was a pianist, but proficient enough as a violinist
to become Kapellmeister at the Karltheatre, Vienna,
in 1865. He was a prolific composer, and has left to
his credit many compositions for the piano and five or
six operas.
<h4>610 Love's Dream after the Ball</h4>
Nothing could be more bewitching than this
little tune. It is old-old enough to prove its
goodness. It is exquisitely beautiful.
<h3>DAVIS, Arthur 1877-</h3>
Arthur Davis was born in Birmingham, England. His
musical education included piano, organ, voice, theory
and composition. With such an equipment, Mr. Davis
was well qualified to fill the many important positions
which have fallen to his lot.
<p>
He came to America in 1911 and has since that time
made a name for himself as a concert organist and
teacher. He is now choirmaster and organist of
enriat Church Cathedral in St. Louis.
<p>
Mr. Davis' compositions include works for organ,
piano and voice.
