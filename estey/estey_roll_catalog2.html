<h3>1.0 Introduction</h3>
The number of bulletins issued since the first
volume of the music catalogue was published having
become cumbersome, it has been thought, for
the convenience of our customers, best to issue another
volume. This second volume is arranged
alphabetically by composers, with an index at the
back of the book, including prices of all rolls listed.
Biographical sketches not contained in Volume I
are included in these pages and the compositions
arranged since the last bulletin was printed, some
twenty-five in number, are included in this edition
and will not appear in bulletins.
<h3>2.0 CATALOGUE OF MUSIC VOLUME II</h3>
<h3>ALBERT, L.</h3>
<h4>448 Cherry</h4>
Here is a sparkling bit of melody which we have
put on a roll for dance purposes. It is entirely
satisfactory as a musical number also, but its
strongest appeal is to those who dance. It is
very popular as a one-step and is enjoying a
degree of popularity.
<h3>ANDREWS, Mark 1875-</h3>
This noted organist was born in Gainsborough. England
in 1875, and came to the Umted States in 19002,
since which time he has resided in Montclair, N. J.
He is one of the best-known organists in the New
York district, and as a composer stands high, having
published over one hwndred works, including two
sonatas for organ. He is organist at the First Congregational
Church, Montclair.
<h4>455 Venetian Idyl</h4>
This is in effect a delightful little barcarole or
boat song. It has the graceful rhythm of the
barcarole form and is charming in both melody
and harmony.
<h4>478 Serenade</h4>
"Serenade" is a very indefinite term as applied
to a musical composition. Therefore, like most
other titles, its principal use is as a means of
identification. No designation could add to, or
detract from, the innate beauty of this little
thing. As in all the work of this composer, this
serenade reveals a remarkable gift of melody,
and as the harmonic setting is highly appropriate,
the result could be nought but enjoyable.
It is a little gem.
<h3>ARENSKY, Anton Stepanovitch 1861-1906</h3>
This well-known Russian composer and pianist was
born at Novgorod, July 31, 1861, and died in a sanatorium
at Tarioki, Finland, February 26, 1906, after
a long illness. He was a pupil of Johanssen and
Rimsky-Korsakow and in, 1882 was appointed Professor
of Harmony and Composition at the Imperial
Conservatory at Moscow. In 1895 he became conductor
of the Imperial Court Choir at Petrograd.
Arensky's muse was lyrical rather than dramatic, and
his smller numbers for the piano are particularly
delightful. suggesting Tchaikowsky. His works include
operas and most of the larger forms. 
<h4>528 Romance</h4>
This is a fair sample of the lyric quality of this
composer. He was much at home in things
such as this-and what could be prettier! It is
melodious and poetic in the extreme. The
harmonies are characteristic of the Russian
school and need no further recommendation.
<h3>ATHERTON, F.</h3>
<h4>416 Reverie</h4>
It is fortunate that so many things originally
written for the piano are satisfactorily adaptable
to the organ. Verily, the true greatness of
the pipe organ is found in ability to do all things
well.
<p>
In the case of hand-playing this trait of the
organ is limited to the technical ability of the
performer. The roll, however, recognizes no
such limitations, and it seems to delight in the
perforrpance of the most startling technical
difficulties. All this, however, is by the way.
The present number is a fugitive conceit for the
piano which loses none of its charm as a result of
its adaptation to the organ, and will be a pleasure
to all who hear it.
<h3>BACH, Johann Sebastian</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>647 Fantasie and Fugue in G Minor</h4>
Of all the Bach fugues for organ, this is the 

greatest. It is known as the "Great G Minor." 

It is wonderful when first heard, and grows 

more wonderful with each successive hearing. 

It should be listened to with the greatest attention.
Its depths of beauty are not to be fathomed
by the casual listener. It must be studied, 

as is an antique work of art.
<p> 

The fantasie, which is really an introduction, is a 

gigantic recitative,-like the oration of a Cicero 

or Socrates. It is Bach with a free rein. Those 

who are accustomed to think of Bach as conventional
will do well to give particular attention to 

this fantasie.
<p> 

It serves its purpose well in preparing the mind 

for the wonderful fugue which follows. 

<h4>663 Gavotte, from the Sixth Violin Sonata</h4>
This is a very famous gavotte from the last of
Bach's six sonatas for the violin. What charming
dance music it is! It is as dignified as a
minuet, but much more sprightly and vivacious.
With the minuet it divides honors as the most
charming of the old dance forms. No finer
example of this fascinating form exists than this
one.
<h3>BAGLEY, E. E.</h3>
<h4>371 National Emblem March</h4>
This is a stirring march, which through sheer
merit has won its way into popular favor. The
organ does full justice to its martial swing, and
falls little short of the effect produced by a
military band.
<h3>BALL, Ernest R. 1878-</h3>
This composer-sometimes called the "American
Tosti"--was born in Cleveland, July 21, 1878. He
was educated at the Cleveland Conservatory, and has
written more real successes than any other American
composer. Some of his most popular hits were "Love
Me and the World Is Mine," "In the Garden of My
Heart," "A Little Bit of Heaven," "Mother Machree,"
etc.
<h4>558 Down the Trail to Home, Sweet Home</h4>
This is a very popular waltz song which we have
arranged on the roll for dance purposes. It
fulfills its mission ideally. 
<h3>BARON, Maurice</h3>
<h4>549 An Indian Legend</h4>
Here is a really charming number which has in
it enough of exotic flavor to justify the title.
Four seemingly indefinite measures introduce a
beautiful theme which flows along gracefully for
a few measures when the introductory measures
appear as a counterpoint to the main theme.
The middle part is in splendid contrast, and
rises to a stirring climax. The:first theme then
reappears with a delightful flute obligato, leaving
the last word for the solo violin.
<h3>BARTHELMY, R.</h3>
<h4>555 Caressing Butterfly</h4>
This is a very pretty ballad-like melody with
just enough accompaniment to support it.
There is ample opportunity for the use of various
solo stops, and this opportunity has not been
overlooked in the arrangement. It is the sort of
thing that sounds best when all is quiet and the
lights are dim, and when one is in a meditative
mood.
<h3>BARTLETT, Homer Newton 1845·1910</h3>
Homer N. Bartlett was one of the best-known and
ablest of American composers. He was born in Olive,
N. Y., December 28, 1845, and soon showed unmistakable
evidence of great musical talent. He studied
piano with S. B. Mills, Max Braun and others until
1861. He played the organ in a number of New
York churches, his last position as organist being at
the Madison Avenue Baptist Church, where he played
for thirty-one years. He died on April 2, 192O. In
every sense he was an American-made musician. He
left behind many published works of worth, which
include nearly all of the orthodox forms, and a goodly
number in manuscript which the public will be interested
in hearing. The latter include a three act opera,
"La Valliere:' an oratorio, "Samuel," and a symphonic
poem, "Apollo."
<h4>484 Meditation Serieuse</h4>
This is one of the best-known and most pretentious
of Bartlett's compositions for organ.
While it is a little reminiscent of Wagner, it is
nevertheless a delightfully original composition
and brimful of innate beauty. It contains some
very striking harmonic progressions, and is no
less interesting melodically. It reveals the sterling
musicianship of the composer, and is a
splendid composition in every sense.
<h3>BATISTE, Edouard</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>660 Larghetto in E flat</h4>
Batiste wrote many things such as this, and they
are all worthy a hearing. He had a wonderful
gift of melody which he always supported by
appropriate and attractive harmonies. Here we
have a simple and pretty theme voiced in the
first instance with a simple accompaniment.
On the second appearance of the theme, after a
short interlude, we find it treated with a florid
accompaniment. Here we find Batiste doing
the sort of thing he liked best to do. It is a
really delightful little thing and characteristic
of the composer.
<h3>BEETHOVEN, Ludwig van</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>387 Symphony No. 5 in C Minor Allegro con Brio-First Movement</h4>
Of all classic symphonies, this is the one which
is most often played. The first movement is famous
for the brevity of its first and principal
theme, which consists of the first four notes
heard-three short and a long one. What can
be said about this theme that is new!
The music lover is familiar with the various
theories concerning it, any or all of which are
correct or erroneous, according to point of view.
After all, what is the use of all the talk about
what music means! The very tune which would
provoke a feeling of sadness in one would move
another to mirth, and to still another be whimsical,
capricious, or bizarre.
Beethoven himself said of his Pastoral Symphony-his
only attempt at symphonic programme music-that it
was "rather an expression
of feeling than a picture." Incidentally he
failed to state what feeling it expressed.
This wonderful music has a story for all; let it tell it.
<h4>388 Symphony No.5 in C Minor Third (Scherzo) and Fourth (A1legro) Movements</h4>
To most people this Scherzo seems to open with
an interrogation-which meets with an immediate
reply. As though the answer were unsatisfactory,
the query is repeated but meets with
the same response.
<p>
Then begins one of the most charming musical
conversations extant. What it is about must
be left to the listener. One may find much of
interest concerning this Symphony and others
in Philip H. Goepp's work, "Symphonies and
Their Meaning," to which sterling work we
would recommend all who are interested in
musical matters.
<p>
The present roll contains also the Finale of the
Symphony, giving it without pause as was the
intention of the composer.
<p> 

The last movement is an exultant march of 

gigantic proportions, interrupted by a short 

reference to the Scherzo, after which the March 

theme again takes the reins. At the close of the 

movement, the pace quickens into a Presto and 

the triumphant conclusion is at hand. 

<h4>400 Symphony No.6, Op.68 (Pastoral)</h4>
The Pastoral Symphony was written in the
wooded meadows near Vienna in the summer of
1808. Beethoven's inscription on the score may
be translated as follows, "The pleasant, cheerful
feelings which arise in man on arriving in
the country." He also adds that it is more an
expression of feeling than a painting.
There is, in the British Museum, a book of
sketches concerning this Symphony in Beethoven's
own hand, and in them he says that "The 

hearer is to be allowed to find out the situations 

for himself."
<p>
This would seem to indicate that Beethoven was 

very skeptical as to the power of music to engender
definite impressions, a fact in keeping 

with his general good sense with regard to music 

matters. The music is delightful and satisfying,
and it matters little what it means. 

<h4>411 Scherzo-Andante Scherzoso from String Quartette" Op. 18, No.4</h4>
Here is Beethoven in a playful humor! To 

many this statement may seem incompatible 

with the generally accepted idea of Beethoven's 

character. As a matter of fact, Beethoven had 

a sense of humor such as was possessed by few 

of the great composers.
<p> 

He was, perhaps, excelled in this particular by 

no one except Haydn. Surely he needed something
to balance the serious side of his life. 

This number is one of the brightest gems of 

musical composition. It has definite form; 

melody in profusion; and harmonies so simple, 

quaint and appropriate as to give the impression
that no other harmonies could be possible.
It is one of the most spontaneous, effervescent
and exuberant examples of writing extant.
<h4>412 Allegro from String Quartette, Op. 18, No.5</h4>
The combination of two violins, viola and 'cello
has furnished a vehicle for the sublimest inspirations
of most of the classical composers. The
form, as we know it, was originated by Haydn,
and is nothing more nor less than the sonata or
symphony form applied to four-part writing.
The early quartettes of Haydn were feeble and
immature things, but the child of Haydn's mind
grew to manhood and he ,left many quartettes
which are today'standards. Mozart bridged the
gap to Beethoven and left behind him twentysix
immortal quartettes.
<p>
Beethoven, unlike some of the others, seemed to
experience no handicap in having to write for
only four fiddles, instead of a full orchestra, and
his quartettes are just as symphonic as though
they had been called sympnonies, the only difference
being that in one case he wrote a
symphony for a quartette of strings, and in the
other for a full orchestra.
<p>
The present roll is the first movement of the
celebrated quartette in A major, and is an
example of Beethoven in his cheeriest mood. It
is full of interesting dialogue, and there is not a
dull moment in it.
<h4>427 Allegro ma non tanto, Op. 18, No. 4</h4>
The Number 4 Quartette is perhaps the best
known of the six contained in Opus 18, and indeed
is a general favorite among the earlier
quartettes. While the present movement is
purely orthodox from a Beethoven point of
view, being in the sonata form invented by
Beethoven and used by him and all other composers
since, it is not so elaborate as many of the
later opera in quartette form. It is no less
charming, howev~r, on account of its comparative
simplicity.
<h4>433 Adagio from Moonlight Sonata, Op. 27, No.2</h4>
Beethoven did nothing in the way of piano compositions
that is more widely known or more
passionately loved than the so-called Moonlight
Sonata. Nothing could be more beautiful than
the plaintive, soul-stirring theme of this movement.
<p>
The silly name which it bears is derived from a
criticism of the sonata by Rellstab which mentioned
the moonlight on the Lake of Lucerne.
It might just as appropriately bear any other
title. It is a work of superlative beauty and
needs no sobriquet to arouse interest or stimulate
imagination.
<h4>435 Minuetto, Op. 18, No. 4</h4>
What more need be said of this roll than that
it is taken from a Beethoven string quartette?
Such a minuet could not have been written by
anyone else. Beethoven was always Beethoven!
His earliest compositions resembled those of
no other composer except in form. His remarkable
naivete and ingenuousness were his chief
characteristics through life. Any movement
from a Beethoven quartette is a "thing of
beauty and a joy forever."
<h4>526 Allegretto alia Polacca</h4>
This is not only "like a Polacca" but it is a Polacca.
It is from the delightful Serenade, Op. 8,
for Violin, Viola and Violoncello. This whole
trio bears the stamp of youthful enthusiasm and
is one of the most fascinating things Beethoven
did in early life. That Beethoven liked it in his
after years-although he cared little for his
early work-is proven by the fact that he arranged
this serenade for piano and violin and
called it Notturno, Op. 42. Beethoven's facility
in writing for a limited number of instruments
was never better shown than in this, the daintiest
of things. There is no adjective which adequately
defines it,-it must be heard.
<h4>533 Larghetto from Second Symphony</h4>
It is readily discovered by students of Beethoven
that his music may be divided into periods.
That is to say, certain characteristics are present
in many of his works which seem to place them
naturally into a group. Nothing was too good
for Beethoven, and he very wisely began his
career as a composer with Haydn and Mozart
as his models. They represented the best in
music, and it was natural that the youthful
genius of Beethoven should aim high.
<p>
Before long, however, he felt a certain restraint
in the use of the strict forms employed by
Haydn and Mozart, and he began to leave the
beaten path and start out for himself, refusing
to be dictated to by anybody or anything except
that rare thing within him which we call 
genius. The noted student and writer, Herr
von Lenz, places the Second Symphony, Op. 36,
in the first period, and, singularly enough, be
places Op. 26, Op. 27 and Op. 31-which were
written at least a year earlier than Op. 36-in
the second period. It is evident, therefore, that
chronology plays little part in the arrangement
of the learned writer. It would seem that Beethoven
at times felt a little strange and lonely
while exploring, and returned temporarily to
the familiar paths of the past. But it was only
temporary, for his progress was inevitable.
<p>
The Larghetto from the Second Symphony is
as strongly characteristic of Beethoven as anything
he did later in life. It may lack some of
the finesse of his later works, but the divine
spark illumines it from beginning to end. It is
superlatively beautiful.
<h4>557 Scherzo from Second Symphony</h4>
This Scherzo is in the form invented by Beethoven,
and used by him in most of his symphonies.
It is a youthful Beethoven that speaks,
but it is as characteristic of him as anything
achieved later in life. No one else could have
done it.
<h4>575 Adagio Molto, from First Symphony</h4>
This is the first movement of Beethoven's First
Symphony. Aside from its native beauty and
great musical worth, it is interesting to note how
thoroughly characteristic of the mature Beethoven
it is. It is a perfectly easy matter to
place the works of Beethoven into periods, and
it has been done. In other words, his progress
in the technique of composition is not only discoverable,
but obvious. He was a master from
the beginning. His works are individual to a
greater extent than those of any other composer.
Anyone familiar with his works would
easily discover, upon hearing this first symphony,
the composer of the ninth, or of any of
the others. The touch of the master is ever
present. This movement is much less involved
than some of the later works, but is just as
charming as anything can be.
<h4>579 Allegretto, Second Movement, Seventh Symphony</h4>
The Seventh Symphony has been called the
"Poem of Earth and Humanity"-a rather
high-sounding title, but perhaps as good as any
-certain as it is that it is Beethoven in a rare
vein. The first theme is dirgelike. in its rhythm
and harmonies. The second melody is in the
major and abandons the solemn vein. It is a
lyrical gem. Both themes seem strangely
prophetic of Schubert. A period of contrapuntal
and fugal development brings on again
the mournful first theme which sings itself to a
peaceful end, and with the end of this allegretto
comes the end of one of the greatest compositions
in music literature.
<h4>583 Gavotte in F Major</h4>
We have put this little piece on the organ as
much for its historical interest as for any other
reason. It lacks none of the essentials of a fine
gavotte, but its greatest interest lies in the fact
that it is a recently discovered effort of Beethoven's
youth-sixteen years of age. We give
the history of it, quoting Harold Bauer:
"The present edition of an unpublished gavotte
by Beethoven is due to investigations made in
1908 by Messrs. Georges de St. Foix and
Theodore de Wyzewa with the object of establishing
the authenticity of certain autograph
manuscripts heretofore attributed to Mozart.
"These manuscripts, originally in the possession
of the Emperor of Austria, were presented by
him, oddly enough, to no less a person than
the Sultan Abdul-Aziz of Turkey, who subsequently
gave them to his music director, Guatelli
Pasha. The well-known English collector,
Julian Marshall, bought them from Guatelli's
son and they were ultimately acquired by the
British Museum.
<p>
"A close examination of these manuscripts resulted
in the startling conclusion that not only
had a serious error been committed in attributing
them to Mozart, but that the idiosyncrasies
of style and handwriting proved beyond the possibility
of doubt that they could have emanated
from no other pen than that of Beethoven.
<p>
"This charming gavotte, which represents Beethoven
in his earliest and consequently most
Mozartian period (about 1786), was played for
the first time by Mme. Olga Samaroff and the
editor at a concert given by the Beethoven Association
on January 13, 1920, in New York."
<h4>631 Tempo Ordinario d' un Minuetto</h4>
This is an adaptation of the wonderful minuet
from the Serenade for Flute, Violin, and Viola,
Op. 25. No other composer ever approached
Beethoven in his ability to write for a small 
number of instruments. In this line he had no
competitor. This minuet is rather unique in
form in that it has two trios, after each of which
the first two strains are played. Itis Beethoven
at his best. Nothing more daintily beautiful
was ever conceived.
<h4>641 Adagio Cantabile from Septet, Op.20</h4>
We have from time to time remarked in these
pages that nothing could be more exquisite than
a Beethoven slow movement. That assertion
still stands, and we now offer more evidence as
to its truthfulness.
<p>
This famous composition, which is nothing more
nor less than a symphony for seven instruments,
was written for violin, viola, 'cello, double bass,
clarinet, bassoon and horn, and dedicated to the
Empress Maria Theresa. In the organ adaptation
we have given strict attention to the original
scoring, with the result that the arrangement
lacks little, if any, of the charm due to the unique
selection of instruments for which it was written.
It is a most exquisite composition faithfully
given by the roll.
<h4>722 Sonata Pathetique, First Movement</h4>
Here we have a movement from one of Beethoven's
early sonatas which lends itself to organ
adaptation in a manner which will surprise those
who believe (or pretend to so believe) that piano
music should be performed on the piano only.
One only has to hear the wonderful introduction
to realize that the piano never could equal the
organ in this particular thing. The title
"Pathetique" is extremely apt. The main body
of this movement is quite equal to the introduction
in effectiveness.
<h4>733 Coriolanus Overture</h4>
Of all the overtures of Beethoven this one to
Coriolanus, a tragedy by Colin, is perhaps the
most popular.
<p>
It is certainly as beautiful as any, and by many
thought to be Beethoven's best work in the
overture form. It was written in 1807. He
was quite as much at home in the overture form
as in the symphony form, and his marvelous
gift of melody, coupled with his wonderful
technique of composition, are just as apparent
here as in the symphony.
<h4>736 Prometheus Overture</h4>
"The Men of Prometheus" is the title of the
ballet of which this is the overture. This overture
and seventeen other numbers comprise the
only ballet that Beethoven wrote. The overture
alone lives by virtue of its value as a concert
number. The entire ballet was performed in
1801 in Vienna, but little if any of the music is
now known except the wonderfully brilliant
overture, which we have very effectively arranged
for the organ, from the orchestral score.
<h4>740 Leonore Overture, No.3</h4>
It is very well known that Beethoven wrote
but one opera. The libretto was adapted by
Joseph Sonnliethner from Bouilly's "Leonore
or l'Amour conjugal." He received the text in
the winter of 1804, and composed the opera at
Hetzendorf in the summer.
<p>
The thing that is of particular interest in connection
with this overture is that he wrote four
overtures to his only opera.
<p>
The opera was first produced at Vienna, on
November 20, 1805, and the overture used was
the one now known as Leonore Overture, No.2.
The libretto was then reduced to two acts, and
three numbers taken from the opera. The above
overture, Leonore No.8, was then composed.
<p>
After the death of the Italian director of the
opera at Prague, and the adoption of German
opera there, Beethoven, in the hope of having
his opera performed by Liebich, the new director,
wrote what we know as Leonore No.1.
<p>
The performance, however, did not take place
and the No. 1 Overture remained in manuscript
until after Beethoven's death.
<p>
The No. 8 Overture is widely known as a concert
number and is a very great favorite.
<h4>742 Egmont Overture</h4>
Beethoven composed this overture for the drama
by Goethe. It is supposed by some commentators
to express the plot of the drama in music.
Beethoven did little in the way of programme
music; his best-known effort being the Pastoral
Symphony, of which he said it was "more an
expression of feeling than of painting." It is
doubtful if the overture is intended to more
than depict certain moods.
<p>
All of this, however, has nothing whatever to do
with the musical worth of this masterpiece. It
needs no programme. It is well able to stand as
a gorgeous composition and needs the support
of no plot, or other extraneous element.
<h3>BERLIN, Irving</h3>
Born in Russia, this composer of popular music came
to America in youth and began composing some of the
lighter pieces. His first hit--one of the first ragtime
songs-was "Alexander's Ragtime Band." He also
composed "Everybody's Doing It" and many other
popular songs.
<h4>559 Tell Me, Little Gypsy</h4>
This is the song hit of Ziegfeld Follies of 1920.
It is arranged as a fox trot, in which form it is
tremendously popular.
<h3>BERLIOZ, Hector 1803-1869</h3>
Berlioz was born at La-Cote-St.-Andre, near Grenoble,
on December 11, 1803. He was the son, of a
country doctor who educated him for the practice of
medicine. We have intimated somewhere in these
paragraphs that a boy who was predestined to become
a musician would overcome any obstacles which were
thrown in his way. The case of Berlioz is additional
proof of our point.
<p>
The most impressionable years of his life were wasted
in the perfunctory study of a profession toward which
(to use his own phrase) he felt nothing better than a
"cold disgust," He finaUy decided upon a musical
career and burned all bridges behind him. His allowance
from home was cut off and he found himself in
such extreme poverty that he was compelled to maintain
himself by singing in a chorus at one of the small
theatres.
<p>
He was admitted as a pupil at the Conservatoire, and
made marvelously rapid progress. He is said to have
lost much, however, by his intractability. He jumped
at conclusions and had little respect for, or paticnce
with, academic methods. After years of disappointment,
he won the Prix de Rome with his cantata, "La
Mort de Sardanapole."
<p>
The terms of the Prix de Rome imposed three years of
travel-the first two to be spent in Italy. He could
not bear expatriation, however, and after eighteen
months he petitioned the Ministry to allow him to return
to Paris, Between 1837 and 1840 he began to
receive recognition. The French Government commissioned
him to write a requicm and paid him a fee
of four thousand francs. In 1834 Paganini paid him
twenty thousand francs for "Harold en Italie." In
1840 he received ten thousand francs for the "Symphonic
Funebre et Triomphale;"
<p>
Most of his works are in the larger forms, consisting
of cantatas, oratorios, symphonies, etc. Among his
literary works, one will hold its place at the top for all
time: his work on orchestration.
<h4>600 Rakoczy March from the Damnation of Faust</h4>
Many are the beliefs as to the origin of this
march, made famous by Berlioz. Its composition
has been attributed to an Austrian prince, 
Rakoczy Ferencz, early in the seventeenth century.
By others it is supposed to have been
composed by Michael Barna, court violinist to
Prince Franz Rakoczy, the second.
<p>
In any event, it was handed down by the gypsies
and Hungarians and put to paper by Carl
Vaczek.
<p>
Berlioz orchestrated it and used it in his
"Damnation of Faust," and, believing in the
eternal fitness of things, transferred the first
scene of the work to Hungary.
<h3>BERNARD, Felix, and BLACK, Johnny S.</h3>
<h4>452 Dardanella</h4>
It is probable that no example of popular writing
has created such a furore as this one in the
same length of time. It is being whistled, sung
and danced by everybody. It is simply impossible
to get away from it. We have produced it
on a roll for dance purposes, and fox-trotting
to its captivating rhythm will be found an enjoyable
pastime.
<h3>BIGGS. Richard Keys 1886-</h3>
This well-known organist was born at Glendale, Ohio,
September 16, 1886. He was educated at the University
of Michigan, studied music at the Cincinnati College
of Music ard in London. His activities, as
organist of one of the large Brooklyn churches, were
interrupted by the war. After receiving his discharge
he returned to Brooklyn and resumed the practice of
his profession. He has made a number of organ
arrangements of operatic and piano compositions, and
a few of his original compositions have been published.
<h4>608 Sunset Meditation</h4>
It is unostentatious, and beautiful in its simplicity-a
pretty melody, delightfully clothed
with the simplest harmonies.
<h3>BIZET, Georges</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>397 L'Arlesienne, First Suite for Orchestra. Minuetto</h4>
The play for which the music was written was a
failure from the first. Bizet, seeming to realize
that it was the text, rather than the music, which
was responsible for the failure, resolved to put
to use some of the good music and selected some
of the best of the numbers, from which he made
two orchestral suites. The First Suite especially
has become a great favorite at orchestra concerts.
The present minuet is one of much grace
and charm, and is delightfully given by the organ.
<h4>409 Farandole from L'Arlesienne</h4>
This is one of the numbers rescued from the ill fated
play by Daudet, for which Bizet composed
the music. As is well known, after the
failure of the play, Bizet got together a few of
the best musical numbers and made them into
two suites. The present number is from the first.
<p>
Little is known as to the origin of the Farandole,
and one cannot do better for a description of it
than to turn to "Grove's Dictionary," from
which we quote the following:
<p>
"The Farandole consists of a long string of young
men and women, sometimes as many as a hundred in
number, holding one another by the hands, or by ribbons
or handkerchiefs. The leader is always a bachelor,
and he is preceded by one or more musicians playing
the galoubet, i.e., a small wooden flute-a-bec, and
the tambourin. With his left hand the leader holds
the hand of his partner, in his right he waves a flag,
handkerchief, or ribbon, which serves as a signal for
his followers. As the Farandole proceeds through 
the streets of the town, the string of dancers is constantly
recruited by fresh additions. The leader (to
quote the poet Mistral) 'makes it come and go, turn
backwards and forwards-sometimes he forms it into
a ring, sometimes winds it in a spiral, then he breaks
off from his followers and dances in front, then he
joins on again, and makes it pass rapidly under the
uplifted arms of the last couple.'"
<p>
The Farandole is usually danced at all the great
feasts in the towns of Provence, such as the
feast of Corpus Domini, or the "Coursos de la
Tarasque," which were founded by King Rene
on April 14, 1474, and take place at Tarascon
annually, on July 29. In the latter the Farandole
is preceded by the huge effigy.of a legendary
monster-the Tarasque-borne by several
men and attended by the gaily dressed chevaliers
de la Tarasque.
<h4>718 Adagietto, Le Carillon, from First L'Arlesienne Suite, No.1</h4>
We have already stated in connection with the
Minuet from this Suite (No. 397), that the
play for which this music was written was a
failure. It is fortunate that Bizet realized the
value of the music and arranged various numbers
into the two suites which are known so well. 
Otherwise we should have been deprived of
some beautiful music.
<p>
Philip Hale, the well-known critic, says of the
Adagietto, "I know of nothing in dramatic
music that approaches this adagio, which not
only accentuates the Biblical sublimity of the
text, but rises to a height of pathos beyond the
reach of word or gesture."
<p>
The Carillon depicts the gaiety of the betrothal
of Frederi and Vivette and the festival of Saint Eloi.
The three incessantly recurring notes
represent bells. The andantino, the middle
part, is the entrance of Mere Renaud, one of
the characters in the play. After this, the Carillon
proceeds to a brilliant end.
<h4>616 Le Retour (The Return)</h4>
Bizet is, of course, chiefly known for his opera
"Carmen." His "Pearl Fishers" is fairly well
known also, as is his Arlesienne Suite. A
simple song without words from his pen, however,
is something hardly to be expected. Here
it is, though, and it is a lovely thing. The orchestras
in some of the large "movie" theatres
have recently discovered its beauty and play it
often. It is likely, therefore, to be recognized
by many who have wondered what it was. The
secret is now out, as a result of this effective roll. 
<h3>BLAUFUSS, Walter</h3>
<h4>453 My Isle of Golden Dreams</h4>
This is a dreamy, quiet waltz which is immensely
popular. It is being played in theatres at times
when soft music is necessary, and is a great
favorite for dance purposes.
BOELLMANN, Leon 1862-1897</h3>
This famoult organist and composer was born in
Ensisheim. Alsace, September 25, 1862, and died in
Paris, October 11, 1897. He was a pupil of Gigout
at the Niedermeyer School. He has written in almost
every form, and was known far and wide for his wonderful
organ playing. His compositions are graceful
and pure in style, showing remarkable knowledge of
form and facility of technique.
<h4>392 Minuet Gothique (Suite Gothique)</h4>
The suite, of which this graceful minuet is a
part, was dedicated to William C. Carl, the
well-known American organist.
<p>
It is a composition of much merit, and has attained
a degree of popular favor which has required
all concert organists to include it in their
repertoire.
<p>
The suite contains besides the minuet, three
numbers, "Choral," "Priere a Notre-Dame,"
and "Toccata." 
<h4>645 Fantasie Dialogue</h4>
This delightful composition was originally written
for organ and orchestra, but was subsequently
arranged by the composer for the organ 

alone. It is the latter form that we have used 

in the roll.
<p>

A happy choice of thematic material and consummate
skill in the development of it, are characteristic
of Boellmann, and this combination is 

to be found in this roll. More need not be said 

in praise of it. 

<h3>BOROWSKI, Felix 1872-</h3>
This composer and critic was born in Westmoreland,
England, March 10 1872. He was educated privately,
studied violin and piano with private teachers
in London and at the Cologne Conservatoire, his
teacher in composition being Gustave Jensen. For
many years he has been active in musical matters in
Chicago, as critic, teacher, lecturer and composer.
His works include two suites for orchestra, two pieces
for string orchestra, two sonatas and a suite for
organ, a sonata and about sixty pieces for piano,
many vioUn solos and about fifteen songs.
<p>
He possesses a wonderful gift of melody, and his works
all show the hand of the skilled workman. 
<h4>492 Chanson de Mai</h4> 

This "Song of May" is a very beautiful thing. 

It has as graceful a theme as could be desired 

and the thematic material is treated in a masterful
manner. It is a pleasure to find a critic who 

can do things other than to find fault. Borowski
is unique in this respect, and has in this 

composition given us a charming little work. 

<h4>527 Reverie</h4>
A dreamy melody, a thing full of repose is this
from beginning to end. Slippers, a cigar, an
easy chair, quiet and such a tune are all a tired
man could ask.
<h4>603 Priere</h4>
Felix Borowski is a musician and composer of
exceptional ability. He never writes below a
very high level which he seems to have set for
himself. He has done some big things-a
sonata and suite for organ, for instance, both of
which we hope sometime to put on a roll for
the edification of Estey Organ owners. At this
time we are especially concerned with this
smaller number, "Priere." It is a beautiful
work full of real devotional feeling and strikingly
original. 
<h3>BRAHMS, Johannes</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>659 Allegro</h4>
There is never any discussion nowadays about
the quality of Brahms' symphonies. They are
the work of a genius-the last of a long line of
German 	geniuses of which Bach was the first.
There is, however, a wide difference of opinion
as to the quality of that elusive ingredient of
the symphonic formula which entrances the
listener and holds his interest unfalteringly.
To the student, Brahms presents a different
problem. To him, Brahms is like an unexplored
country-new and novel beauties everywhere.
Structurally, the four symphonies are
gigantic masterpieces, and there is little in
music which will pay equal dividends on genuine study.
<p>
One of these symphonies-the second-permits
of no argument on any score. It is gorgeous
from beginning to end.
<p>
For the present roll, we have chosen the first
movement. We are confident that a better
choice could not have been made. To quote
Othello, it "will sing the savageness out of a
bear." 
<h4>714 Allegro con Spirito, Finale of Second Symphony</h4>
The Second Symphony is the great favorite of
all the Brahms symphonies, four in number.
The reason is not difficult to find: it is tuneful
and splendid in form. This constituent, form,
is the greatest single element in the writing of
a symphony. It would be possible to write an
atrocious theme and give it the necessary treatment
to make of it a symphony, but such a thing
would not be beautiful. It is form which relates
architecture to music. Form cannot make a
beautiful thing out of inappropriate materials it
is only when we have proper thematic material,
the design of an artist, and the artisanship
of a master that such things as this symphony
are produced.
<h3>BREAU, Louis, and COOPER, Joe
<h4>718 I Want My Mammy, introducing "Just a Little Love Song"</h4>
We have given here the very popular fox trot,
"I Want My Mammy," and have introduced
the chorus of "Just a Little Love Song." Such
an arrangement has proved to be very popular
for dance purposes. 
<h3>BREWER, John Hyatt</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>678 An Autumn Sketch</h4>
This is a most dainty little caprice written for
the organ. It is a seductively tuneful thing,
full of all the traits necessary to the making
of a caprice. As we have it on the roll, it is
most enjoyable.
<h3>BRUCH, Max 1838-</h3>
Perhaps the most eminent of living German composers
is Max Bruch, who was born at Cologne, January 6,
1838. His mother was a distinguished singer, and she
carefully watched the development of her son's musical
talents. He gave extraordinary promise in composition
during his studies with Breidenstein at Bonn, and
in 1852 gained a scholarship of the Mozart foundation
at Frankfort-on-Main for four years, continuing
his studies under Heller, Reinecke and Breuning
at Cologne. From 1858 to 1861 he taught in his
native town, and in 1858 gave there his first work, an
operetta, "Scherz, List und Rache."
<p>
His works number about ninety, including all forms,
with cantatas and vocal works in the majority. 
<h4>628 Adagio from Violin Concerto, Op.26</h4>
For many years the Bruch Concerto has been
the standard by which aspiring violinists have
been measured. Its requirements are very
great-not so much from a standpoint of technique,
but rather from that of tone and breadth
of musical feeling. A mere technician could
only play the notes. Nothing short of a genuine
musician can bring out its true beauty. We
know of nothing more beautiful than this
Adagio, and in its adaptation to the organ it has
lost nothing.
<h3>BULL, Ole Bornemann 1810-1880</h3>
One of the most picturesque figures in the history of
music was the subject of this paragraph. He was the
son of a physician in Bergen who looked with little
favor upon music as a vocation, and therefore sent
him to the University of Christiania to study theology.
In a very short time he was made conductor of a
musical society of that town. He left Norway very
suddenly in 1829-perhaps as a result of some part
he may have taken in the political feeling rampant at
that time. He suffered many hardships during the
next two years, and finally got to Paris, where he
heard Paganini, whose playing had the effect of making
him settle down to vigorous study of the technique
of the violin. His reduced circumstances and necessary
privation brought upon him severe illness and
despondency. Fortunately a benevolent Parisian lady
took a motherly interest in him at this time, and
nursed him back to health-this lady's daughter later
becoming hia wife. After his recovery he made his
first Paris appearance. His success was from that
time asaured, and he created nothing short of a furore
in Italy. He played in all parts of the world to the
delight of all who heard him, except a certain few who
accused him of charlatanism.
<p>
The fact is, that he was extremely eccentric, but was
nevertheless an extraordinarily capable performer
who had a lot of tricks and a technique which was
probably surpassed by no one but Paganini.
<p>
He seldom played any but his own compositions, but
he could find little else to give scope to hia marvelous
technique.
<h4>394 Alpine Maid's Sunday</h4>
Someone may have written a more delicious
melody than this one, but if so, it is unknown
to us. The melodies which will endure the test
of standing absolutely alone-without harmonies-are
few. This is one. The harmony with
which this gem is clothed was supplied by
Svendsen. and could not be surpassed for
beauty, but nothing in the way of a setting
could add a whit to the exquisiteness of the unadorned
beauty of this melody. 
<h3>CESEK, H. A.</h3>
<h4>598 Twilight</h4>
This is a very attractive melody of the sort
which, while written for the piano, fits the organ
as though made to order. We have used a flute
to voice the first part, while the second part is
played on a violin. On the repetition of the first
theme, one of the wood winds sings the melody,
giving way to the flute in a pretty little coda.
<h3>CHAFFIN, Lucien Gates 1846-</h3>
Lucien Gates Chaffin was born at Worcester, Mass.,
March 23, 1846, received his A.B. from Brown University,
1867. He is an educator of note, and was
a concert organiat for many years, also a critic and
lecturer on music. His compositions are comparatively
few, but of very high order of excellence.
<h4>498 In Springtime</h4>
"The heart is young in Springtime.<br>
Birds sing their merriest notes." Old Poem.
<p>
Here is a gorgeous little piece which is full of
merry notes. In form it is like many other
compositions in this style of organ music, but
here the resemblance ceases, for it is better
far better than the average. The middle part is
a sort of bird song cadenza, after which the
unadorned first theme is used for a close.
<h4>568 Wedding Chimes</h4>
Chaffin is a man who has written comparatively
little that has been published. Judging
from his published works, he is an exacting critic
so far as his own works are concerned. Nothing
trivial or commonplace has come from his pen.
"Wedding Chimes" is a good example of a very
high type of organ music. The title is rather
misleading, as the chimes do not appear in it.
The figure in the bass in the last few measures
is distinctly a chime figure and it is this which
really justifies the title.
<h3>CHAMINADE, Cecile</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>475 Pierrette, Air de Ballet, No.5</h4>
This is one of the dainty little things that Chaminade
writes so well for the piano. Like most
of her work in this vein it lacks definite form but
has a sprightly charm all its own and is distinctly
characteristic of her. It has been put on
the roll for the organ; and in the process has lost
none of its beauty. In fact, it is more interesting
because of the added tonal variety.
<h4>594 Serenade</h4>
The conspicuous characteristic of Chaminade's
compositions is grace. They are never big in
conception, but are invariably full of charm.
Indeed, in most instances they are faultless
miniatures which evince the greatest care in
matters of detail and which withstand the closest
and most exacting scrutiny. Such attention
to detail often produces a perfect but far from
interesting result. Not so with Chaminade!
Her work always possesses the innate charm
which is the result of a fine poetic temperament.
This serenade is no exception to the rule. It
is a most bewitching little thing.
<h4>720 La Lisonjera (The Flatterer)</h4>
We have adapted a few of Chaminade's charming
piano pieces to the organ, and without exception
they have been enthusiastically received.
They have all gained rather than lost by being
fitted to the organ. This graceful number is no
exception. It is too well known to require a
description and, being from Chaminade's pen,
it needs no recommendation. 
<h3>CHOPIN, Frederic Francois</h3>
( For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>393 Nocturne in E flat, Op. 9, No.2</h4>
This is the most popular of all Chopin nocturnes,
and deservedly so. It sings itself into
one's soul, and while it is much abused, its claim
to precedence as a lovely melody is not apt to
be seriously disputed. One is likely to be surprised
at the organ rendition as given by the
present roll. It fits the organ as though made
for it.
<h4>421 Nocturne, Op. 55, No. 1</h4>
This familiar Nocturne needs little comment.
It is very characteristic and while by no means
morbid, has a tinge of sadness in it which is unmistakable.
Much has been written about the
effect of Chopin's music, and no man ever
created such violent contrasts of opinion. His
adherents exhausted their supply of adjectives
in his praise, while others, including just as capable
critics, were relentless in their abuse of him.
In the event of such differences of opinion, one
must judge for one's self what is good. Chopin
was trivial at times but never commonplace. No
one can deny that this nocturne is a pretty tune,
and one which grows in favor on acquaintance
<h4>432 Polonaise (Military)</h4>
The precursor of this stately Polish dance is
supposed by some to have been an ancient
Christmas carol. This theory is supported by
the fact that in former times singing accompanied
the dance. The earliest polonaises extant,
however, are purely instrumental, to which fact
is due the more generally accepted belief that
the dance-as known to us at least-is of courtly
origin, and, according to Grove, came about as
follows:
<p>
"In 1573, Henry III of Anjou was elected to
the Polish throne, and in the following year held
a great reception at Cracow, at which the wives
of the nobles marched in procession past the
throne to the sound of stately music. It is said
that after this, whenever a foreign prince was
elected to the crown of Poland, the same ceremony
was repeated, and that out of it the polonaise
was gradually developed as the opening
dance at court festivities."
<p> 

Bach, Handel, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, 

and even Wagner wrote polonaises. It remained
for a native son to develop the national 

dance to its absolute perfection. Before Chopin, 

it was dry and uninteresting; he imbued it with 

new life and spirit, as the present roll will 

testify. 

<h3>COERNE, Louis Adolphe 1870-</h3>
Born in Newark, N.J. February 27, 1870. Was educated
in German and French schools. Graduated from
Boston Latin School in 1888, and Harvard College in
1890. Received the first Ph.D. given by Harvard for
musical work, for his thesis on the Evolution of Modern
Orchestration. He studied composition with J. K.
Paine, violin with Franz Kneisel, organ and composition
with Rheinberger at the Royal Academy, Munich,
from which school he graduated with honors in 1893.
He has led a very active musical life-teaching and
composing. His compositions include a symphonic
poem, "Hiawatha," and two operas, one of which.
"Zenobia," was the first opera by a native of the
United States to be performed in Europe. It was
performed in Bremen, Germany, during the season of
1905-1906. In addition to these are many smaller
works in the usual forms.
<h4>490 The River of Life</h4>
This is a delightfully unpretentious little number
by a man capable of big things. One of the
unmistakable evidences of a big man is his ability
to do the little things well, and keep them
from being commonplace. It has a theme of
unusual beauty, and a middle part which is in
marked contrast. The first theme reappears
and a short coda effects an appropriate close. 
<h4>504 Consecration</h4>
This is one of a number of little things written
by this composer for the organ. It is a delightful
bit of writing and it reveals to the discerning
the musicianship of the composer.
<h3>COHAN, George M. 1878-</h3>
This composer of popular songs made his bow to the
public as an actor as a member of "The Four Cohans."
He has written many successful sketches for vaudeville
and about eighteen plays. His musical ability
is represented by a hundred or more poptilar songs.
<h4>373 Over There</h4>
This is one of the most popular songs inspired
by the war. It has a good swing, and a splendid
war-time quality which is likely to insure its
popularity for some time to come.
<h3>CUI, Cesar Antonovich 1835-</h3>
Thi, famous composer was born at Vilna, January
18, 1835. He is the son of a French officer who, being
unable to follow the retreat from Moscow in 1812, 
remained in Poland, and married a Lithuanian lady,
and became professor in French at the high school at
Vilna.
<p>
Cui received a good preparatory education, and
eventually entered the School of Military Engineering
at St. Petersburg. being appointed to a professorship
after he graduated. He became a recognised authority
on fortification, holding the rank of Lieutenant-General
of Engineers, and has lectured and written much
on the subject.
<p>
Having laid aside his musical tastes during the acquirement
of his military education, he succumbed to
his first love after he had become a full-fledged officer.
His contact with Balakirev had much to do with his
musical enthusiasm. He married a gifted pupil of
Dargomijski, Mlle. Bamberg, and from that time became
very active in composition. Eight operatic
works, over two hundred songs, very many pieces for
piano, strings, orchestra, and many choruses are the
evidence of an etrtremely industrious musical life.
Cui's work is characterized by grace and refined
lyricism. It is seldom tragic.
<h4>547 Orientale</h4>
No one ever wrote miniatures such as this any
better than Cui. He was known as a miniaturist,
and this one example would seem to establish
the claim. It smacks of the Orient, surely,
and is as charming a little thing as could be
found. 
<h3>CZIBULKA, Alphons 1842-1894</h3>
Born at Szepesvavallya, Hungary, on May 14, 1842.
He was a pianist, but proficient enough as a violinist
to become Kapellmeister at the Karltheatre, Vienna,
in 1865. He was a prolific composer, and has left to
his credit many compositions for the piano and five or
six operas.
<h4>610 Love's Dream after the Ball</h4>
Nothing could be more bewitching than this
little tune. It is old-old enough to prove its
goodness. It is exquisitely beautiful.
<h3>DAVIS, Arthur 1877-</h3>
Arthur Davis was born in Birmingham, England. His
musical education included piano, organ, voice, theory
and composition. With such an equipment, Mr. Davis
was well qualified to fill the many important positions
which have fallen to his lot.
<p>
He came to America in 1911 and has since that time
made a name for himself as a concert organist and
teacher. He is now choirmaster and organist of
enriat Church Cathedral in St. Louis.
<p>
Mr. Davis' compositions include works for organ,
piano and voice.
<h4>376 Trailing Arbutus</h4>
This is a charming reverie by a well-known
English organist, now a resident of St. Louis, Mo.
<p>
The opening theme is of a quaint character, and
an interesting and more lively middle part in
marked contrast is a pleasing innovation. After
a somewhat elaborate development of the second
theme, the first theme recurs and serves as
a fitting ending.
<h3>DEBUSSY, Claude Achille</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch aee Catalogue, Volume J)
<h4>403 The Snow is Dancing</h4>
This is Number 4 of a set of children's pieces
by one of the originators of the ultramodern
school. It may be said, also, that this little number
is modern enough to suit the most exacting
in such matters. Its daintiness is its greatest
charm, and it will surely please.
<h3>DEMAREST, Clifford 1874-</h3>
Demarest is a well-known New York organiat who has
composed a goodly number of pieces for the instrument
of his choice, as well as about fifty anthems and 
two sacred-cantatas. His compositions also include a
fantasie for organ and piano, and a number of songs.
He is also the author of "Hints on Organ Accompaniment."
His work is noted for the charm of his melodies.
which are invariably beautiful. They are always
clothed with appropriate harmoniea and all bear the
stamp of sterling musicianship.
<h4>503 Sunset</h4>
This is one of four numbers comprIsmg the
very popular "Pastoral Suite." The first part
is a very graceful melody which gives way to a
chorale-like movement in good contrast. The
first theme recurs with an occasional note on
the chimes which adds materially to the beauty
of the theme as first heard. Two measures of
the chorale and just an echo of the introduction
gracefully effect the close of a delightful
number.
<h3>DETHIER, Gaston Marie 1875-</h3>
Gaston Marie Dethier was born in Liege, Belgium,
on April 19, 1875. Though a Belgian by birth he has
always been regarded in this country as a French
organist. He received his musical education at the
Liege Conservatoire, where he won the gold medal for
piano and organ playing and tke first prize for composition
of a fugue at the age of seventeen. He made
his debut at fourteen at the inaugural recital on the
first tubular-pneumatic organ built in Belgium, at
Malines. In 1894 he was engaged, upon the recommendation
of Guilmant, as organist of St. Francis
Xavier's Church, New York City, where he has remained
until the present time.
<p>
He is actively engaged as a concert organist and
teacher-both privately and at the Institute of Musical
Art. New York.
<p>
Few excel him as a brilliant player on the organ, and
his compositions are widely sought by organists whose
technical equipment is equal to their requirements.
<h4>440 Allegro Gioioso</h4>
This brilliant composition is characteristic of
Dethier and as usual betrays his unusually brilliant
technique. A composer with a limited
technique would never have conceived such a
thing. It is a jolly, rollicking composition-which
at no time expresses a serious thought. Good
humor permeates it and overflows. It would
be difficult indeed to find a number containing
more jollity and mirth than this one.
<p>
It was written for the organ, and the roll gives
it in a manner likely to excite the envy of the
composer himself. 
<h4>462 Barcarole</h4>
From the pen of a composer whose work coruscates
as does Dethier's, one would hardly expect
such a charming bit of simplicity as this Barcarole.
It possesses all the elements of the
boat song-the graceful melody, the swaying
rhythm, etc. That Dethier could write such a
thing proves his musicianship, for only a great
man can do the simple thing so exquisitely as
to avoid the commonplace.
<h4>466 Reverie</h4>
Meditation would have been as good a name but
"what's in a name?" It is both dreamy and
meditative-at times it seems retrospective or
even introspective. Whatever the effect produced,
it is captivating in its quiet simplicity.
<h4>618 Caprice (The Brook)</h4>
Among the difficult concert numbers for organ,
few have enjoyed the popularity of this caprice.
Its technical requirements are such that only
organists of the first class can play it satisfactorily.
Its difficulty does not concern us, however,
for the Estey Organist knows nothing of
difficulties. Its musical value is our chief concern,
and musically it leaves nothing to be desired.
<h4>701 Elegie, Lied, Gavotte</h4>
A number of our clients have complained from
time to time about the brevity of certain of
our rolls. The obvious way of overcoming this
objection is to cut more than one number on a
roll. We shall pursue this policy in the future
as far as it is compatible with good taste.
We have here three little things by a big composer.
They are all delightful and in striking
contrast with each other. Each has a mood of
its own and the combination of the three is a
happy one.
<h3>DETT, R. Nathaniel 1882-</h3>
This pianist and composer was born in Drwmmondville,
P.Q., Canada, in 1882. He graduated from the
Niagara Falls Collegiate Institute in 1905. His musical
education was obtained at the Halsted Conservatory
of Music at Lockport, N.Y., and at Oberlin
College, Oberlin, Ohio. At the latter place, he obtained
the degree of Bachelor of Music. He studied
composition with George W. Andrews and Rossetter
G. Cole, and made his debut all a pianist at Oberlin, 

June, 1908.
<p> 

He is well known as a teacher, and has held very important
positions as director of music in various institutions
of learning. At present he is attached to
the Hampton Institute, Hampton, Va.
<h4>615 Juba</h4>
This is one of five pieces forming the suite, "In
the Bottoms." It is illustrative of negro life
and music. We shall let Mr. Dett describe it:
<p>
"This is probably the most characteristic number
of the suite, as it portrays more of the social
life of the people. Juba is the stamping on the
ground with the foot and following it with two
staccato pats of the hands in 2-4 time. At
least one-third of the dancers keep time in this
way, while the others dance. Sometimes all will
combine together in order to urge on a solo
dancer to more frantic, and at the same time
more fantastic, endeavors. The orchestra usually
consists of a single 'fiddler,' perched high
on a box or table; who, forgetful of self in the
rather hilarious excitement of the hour, does
the impossible in the way of double stopping
and bowing."
<h3>D'EVRY, Edouard 1869-</h3>
Edouard d'Evry, a brilliant organist of French parentage,
received his musical education in London. He
has been organiat of the Brompton Oratory since
1886. Not only has he gained a reputation as a brilliant
performer, but ia known as a composer of organ
pieces, many of which are successful.
<h4>486 Consolation</h4>
This is a composition of distinctly modern tendencies.
It is a really delightful number, written
for the organ, and the more often it is heard
the better it is liked.
<h3>DIGGLE, Roland 1885-</h3>
This composer and organist is well known in the West
and in Canada. He came to Canada from London, his
birthplace, and since 1904 has resided in various parts
of the middle and far West. Since 1914 he has been
organist of St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church
at Los Angeles, Calif., and has made two recital tours
in Canada and one in the United States. He was soloist
at the Panama California Exposition at San Diego
in 1915-1916. Over one hundred of his compositions,
which include many forms, have been published. 
<h4>506 Chant Poetique</h4>
We, in this country, are inclined to look upon a
chant as something of a devotional nature. As
a matter of fact, chant is a French word meaning
song. -It is, therefore, appropriate to designate
a rollicking tune, such as this, a chant. It
is poetical too. A charming rhythm permeates
it from beginning to end, and it is a really delightful
little thing.
<h4>513 At Sunset</h4>
A quiet and beautiful melody is this. It might
have been called a nocturne-which it is. Its
beauty may be attributed to its grace. Serenity
is its keynote.
<h4>521 Reverie Triste</h4>
This song of sadness is a thing of much fascination.
There is nothing dolorous or lugubrious
about it, but it is plaintive in the extreme. It
is one of a number of delightful little pieces
written by this composer for the organ.
<h3>DONALDSON, Walter</h3>
<h4>401 How ' Ya Goin' to Keep Him Down on a Farm?</h4>
<h3>DRDLA, Franz</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>665 Serenade</h4>
There is no more popular composer today in
Bohemia-now a part of Czecho-Slovakia than
Drdla. He has written many pieces for
the concert room which deserve and enjoy a
wide degree of popularity.
Two of them are well known in this country,
namely, Souvenir (Estey Roll No. 349) and
Serenade, the present roll.
Both these compositions were written for the
composer's own instrument, the violin. They
are both gems, and serve well as an example of
the fidelity with which the string tone is reproduced
in Estey organs.
<h3>DUBOIS, Francois Clement Theodore</h3>
(For BiographicaZ Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>707 March Triomphale</h4>
A march of fine spirit and dignity is this one
from the pen of the famous organist of the
Madeleine, Paris. It is typical of the French
style, which is a good style. It is vigorous and
triumphant-and beautiful.
<h3>DVORAK, Antonin</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>405 Bagatello, Op. 47, Nos. 1, 2 and 3</h4>
By virtue of his residence and musical activity
in New York, Dvorak has endeared himself to
Americans generally. It may be said, however,
without fear of contradiction, that his first claim
to favor was through the bewitching beauty of
his compositions-and so should it be. Nevertbeless,
it cannot be denied that a special interest
attaches to all his work because of his sojourn
in the United States.
<p>
Of the five bagatelles in Op. 47, three are given
on this roll, and more delectable music would be
difficult to find. Dvorak was not known as a
composer until his thirty-second year. At that
rather late period in life to begin, a patriotic
hymn struck the popular fancy. In 1877 he was
discovered by Brahms, whose perspicacity in
musical matters caused him to use his influence
with Simrock, the publisher, to publish Dvorak's
compositions. The Slavonic Dances, Op. 46,
were first to appear, and the reception given
them encouraged the publisher to bring out
many compositions which Dvorak had long
despaired of seeing in print. From this time on,
Dvorak was recognized as a finished composer
and his works were much sought after. 
This enchanting music will make its own place
in the hearts of all who hear the roll, and it needs
no description to add to its enjoyment.
<h4>519 Allegro and Larghetto from Terzetto, Op. 74</h4>
Dvorak is best known to us through his symphonies
and quartettes. Here, however, we
have two movements of an exquisite trio for two
violins and viola, which we have put upon a
roll for organ use. It is charming music, bright
and cheery in the first movement, and different
but no less attractive in the wistful larghetto.
The roll gives it on the string stops, producing
the effect intended by the composer with commendable
fidelity.
<h3>EDMOND, Lemaigre</h3>
<h4>510 Prayer</h4>
This is a very beautiful and devotional melody
which is sung on the Vox Humana with an
arpeggio accompaniment on the harp. On
repetition the theme is played on the strings
and a flute obligato weaves its way in and out
in ingenious and delightful fashion. This is a
composition for the organ and the roll does it
full justice. 
<h3>ELGAR, Sir Edward</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch aee Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>487 Chanson de Matin</h4>
Song of the Morning, he calls it, and it is an
appropriate title. It is a charming composition
with the freshness of the dew upon it. Indeed,
it sounds as if it had been written in the morning.
It is a formless little thing which wanders
about in carefree fashion, to the delight of all
who hear it.
<h4>567 Chanson de Nuit</h4>
Much is expected of Elgar, and one is rarely
disappointed. Here is a little song of the night,
written for the violin. We have transcribed it
for the organ with very happy results. It is still
a violin solo, but in the case of the roll the organ
furnishes the violin. Incidentally, this number
provides an excellent opportunity to observe the
fine imitative quality of Estey string stops.
<h4>601 Canto Popoiare</h4>
The popular song of this country is distinctly
different from the kind here recorded. Elgar
has chosen a tune of much beauty and has
clothed it with delightful harmonies in his usual
masterful way. 
<h3>ELLIOTT, Zo</h3>
<h4>368 There's a Long, Long Trail</h4>
Of the many sentimental songs written in the
last few years this is one of the most popular
and one of the best. It has a catchy refrain,
which is known to many who are not familiar
with the rest of the song, and is effectively given
on the organ from the roll.
<h3>FAULKES, William 1863-</h3>
This organist, pianist and composer, was born in Liverpool,
England, November 4, 1863. He has taught in
Liverpool since 1886, is well known as a composer,
having written a concerto for piano, also one for
violin, besides some chamber music and many pieces
for piano. His organ works include the larger forms,
such as concert overtures, etc., also many in the
smaller forms.
<h4>508 Pastorale</h4>
The pastorale is a melody in 6-8, 9-8 or 12-8
time, in imitation of the simple melody of the
shepherd's pipe. A drone bass very often furnishes
the foundation, as is the case with this
one, which is a splendid example of the form. 
<h4>509 Minuet and Trio</h4>
This is a very good example of the minuet form
in the key of B minor, containing excellent
variety both in its subjects as well as in its
treatment. Particularly melodious is the trio
in the key of G major, with its tonic and dominant
pedal. The return to the original subject
is both ingenious and effective.
<h4>536 Barcarole</h4>
This is a fine two-part boat song, with a beautiful
running accompaniment which is as incessant
as the babbling of a brook, and as delightful.
A middle part of considerable vigor furnishes
the necessary contrast and this most
charming number closes with the repetition of
the first theme.
<h4>619 Concert Overture in D</h4>
A composition from the pen of this versatile and
prolific English organist is always worth while.
Here we have an overture written for the
organ, which is a delight. It is fine in form.
beautiful in thematic material and masterful in
workmanship-which is about all that could be
said in praise of any composition.  
<h4>673 Wedding Chimes</h4>
A remarkable chime effect is obtained in this
number by somewhat peculiar registration.
Organists frequently use four- and sixteen-foot
stops together for this purpose, which is what
we have done here. Faulkes was in a particularly
happy frame of mind when he wrote this
charming piece. We have used the registration
he prescribed throughout, thus carrying out the
full intentions of the composer.
<h4>675 Spring Song</h4>
One of the best known of the many spring songs
is this one by the well-known English composer
and organist, William Faulkes. It is a delightful
melody and the workmanship is of the usual
high standard to be expected of him. A very
unique and clever middle part adds wonderfully
to the general scheme. The first theme
then reappears with a florid accompaniment,
adding variety and charm to a very beautiful
and unpretentious bit of writing.
<h4>680 Nocturne</h4>
Not the least of the many talents of this well known
English composer is his remarkable gift
of melody. In a simple form like the nocturne,
melody is the essential thing. In this case the
theme is charming in its simplicity. A rather
more vigorous middle part leads up to a repetition
of the first theme in chords accompanied
by an exceedingly graceful florid figure. It is
a splendid example of the nocturne form.
<h3>FAURE, Jean-Baptiste</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume J)
<h4>463 Romance</h4>
Faure's particular claim to distinction lies in
his ability to write charming melodies. This
one is no exception, and will prove a delight to
all who hear it. In the latter part a second
voice appears and forms a most fascinating
duet which continues to the close.
<h3>FEDERLEIN, Gottfried H. 1883-</h3>
Gottfried H. Federlein was born in New York City,
December 31,1883. He is the son of a famous organist
who is now retired, but is known as a teacher of
singing, also as the author of a "School of Voice Culture,"
and essays on Wagner's "Ring of the Nibelungen." 

Our subject is one of the best-known of American organists
and is a composer of great promise. He secured
his musical education in New York, being the 

pupil of Biedermann, Goetschius and Saar. Besides 

his organ piecea, his compositions include sacred and 

secular songs, and aome music for the violin. 

<h4>474 Scherzo Pastorale</h4>
This might be characterized a scherzo in tempo
and a pastorale in rhythm and form. It certainly
contains elements of both forms, and it
was a happy idea to combine them. In any
event, it is a matter of little moment to us
whether the form is orthodox or not; the result
is highly entertaining and displays a wealth of
ability on the part of the composer. He has
here given us a work of great beauty,
<h3>FERRATA, Giuseppe 1865-</h3>
This pianist and composer was born at Gradoli,
Romagna, January 1, 1865. He studied at the St.
Cecilia Acadamy, at Rome, having won a scholarship
at the age of fourteen. He won the prize of the
Ministry of Public Instruction. After receiving some
lessons from Liszt, he toured Italy as a pianiat, with
much success.
<p>
He came to America and for a number of years was
dean of the Music Department of Beaver College.
Beaver. Pa., and is now head of the Piano Department
and professor of composition at Newcomb College
and Tulane University. New Orleans.
<p>
He was knighted by the King of Portugal in 1887.
<h4>465 Nocturne</h4>
Ferrata's compositions are characterized by a
free flowing melody accompanied by ever changing
harmonies-almost kaleidoscopic at
times. This number is no exception in either
respect. It is dainty at all times, such a thing
as one might expect from a skilled Italian composer.
Indeed, it is a charming bit of melody,
supported by a beautiful and appropriate harmonic
structure.
<h4>488 Reverie Triste, Op. 9, No. 4</h4>
This is the sort of thing one likes to hear
when in a meditative mood. Dim the lights,
and listen to this roll in absolute quiet. If it
does not leave an impression, your case is hopeless.

<h3>FIBICH, Zdenko 1850-</h3>
This composer was born in Seborschitz, Bohemia, December
10, 1850. He studied at Vienna and Prague,
and later became a pupil at the Leipsic Conservatory
under Moscheles, Richter and Jadassohn. His works,
though little known in this country, number about
seven hundred, including operas, symphonic poems,
chamber music, song., etc.
<h4>672 A Melody, A Pensive Mood, Song Without Words</h4>
We have here, on one roll, three miniatures by 

a famous Bohemian composer. These pieces 

are happily mated on the one roll. The moods 

are not dissimilar, yet there is variety enough 

to prevent monotony.
<h3>FOOTE, Arthur William 1858-</h3>
Arthur William Foote is one of the most notable and
prolific American composers. His activities as a composer
have taken in practically all the accepted forms,
and a great quantity of excellent music bears his name.
<p>
He has written much chamber music, most of which
was given its premier performance by the Kneisel
Quartette, a fact which of itself stamps Foote as a
composer of a very high order. Similar testimony
may be found in the fact that the Boston Symphony
Orchestra has done him the honor to give most of his
orchestral wrks their first public reading.
<p>
As a performer on both piano and organ Foote belongs
in the first rank. He was organist of the First
Unitarian Church, Boston, from 1878 to 1910, where
he gave numerous recitals which were largely attended.
<h4>436 Pastorale, Op. 29, No.3</h4>
Almost every composer of note since the time
of Bach and Handel has given expression to
his feelings in a "Pastorale." It would therefore
be surprising if Foote, with his wealth of
melody, should not have tried his hand at this
form. Indeed, it would have been unfortunate,
for here is as pretty a piece of writing as one
could wish. A delightful flowing melody, peaceful
in the extreme, wanders around aimlessly
through a number of different keys, all the while
accompanied by the most exquisite harmonies,
and finally returns home.
<p>
This Pastorale is a most charming thing. It was
made for the organ and it fits.
<h4>683 Nocturne, Op. 50, No. 6</h4>
America has developed few if any better composers
than Arthur Foote. He is a charming
melodist, as is proven by this Nocturne. It is
quiet and peaceful-just the thing to listen to
in a dimly lighted room. 
<h3>FRANCK, Cesar</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch Bee Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>441 Cantabile</h4>
In this Cantabile of Cesar Franck we have a
composition of transcendent beauty. One must
listen a little below the surface to get the wondrous
musical message contained in the superlative
harmonies.
<p>
The food value of compositions such as this
cannot be overestimated. The harmonies are
anything but obvious, yet are not forced or
unnatural. From beginning to end the careful
listener will notice the composer's fondness for
intervals of semitones, both in melodies and
accompaniment, but principally in the latter.
This is not a weakness, but a characteristic, and
one productive of gorgeous effects when applied
with the consummate skill of this great man.
This roll is worthy of all the attention and scrutiny
it can be given. It grows more beautiful
with each hearing.
<h4>543 Piece Heroique</h4>
This is a very pretentious composition for the
organ. It is Franck at his best. All the characteristics
which have stamped him as a modem
genius are here. It is a very wonderful work. 
<h4>651 Choral, A Minor</h4>
This is the third of a set of three chorals written
for the organ by Cesar Franck, the great Belgian
composer. It is also the most popular and
best known of the set.
<p>
In it he betrays unmistakably his allegiance to
Bach. It is a curious circumstance that Franck,
an ultramodern, should have chosen Bach as his
model. Franck lacks nothing in originality, but
there are, undeniably, passages in his writings
which Bach might have written-and to his
credit. The present roll has in it some such
passages, and their analogy is interesting.
<h4>721 Symphony in D Minor</h4>
Cesar Franck, as we have said in our biographical
sketch of him, was a Belgian by birth, but a
Frenchman by adoption.
<p>
It is well to remember this in connection with
the fact that his influence on the French school
of music was far greater than the influence of
the French school upon him. He is said to be
the father of the modem French school. This
is probably so, but if the dear old man could
come to life, it is doubtful if he would recognize
some of his children. 
<p>
Franck was a radical and must have had a hard
time with the skeptics of his day. He felt, however,
that he had a message and that it was his
privilege to deliver it in his own way. Indeed,
such was the case, and what he said could not
have been as well said in any other way, or by
anybody else.
<p>
It is with his only symphony that we have to do
here. In that one symphony he seems to have
epitomized all that went before and all that was
to come in the way of symphonic writing. A
description of it would be most futile. It may
be well, however, to call attention to the use
of the principal theme in all the movements; a
thing which we believe had not been done before.
In the freedom of development and orchestration
he actually rivals Beethoven.
<h3>FRANZOFF, Boris</h3>
<h4>661 Romance</h4>
Romance is perhaps the proper title for this
little composition. As a romance should be, it
is a tender, simple melody of great beauty. 
<h3>FRIML, Rudolf 1881-</h3>
Rudolf Friml waa born in Prague, Bohemia, December
7, 1881. He obtained hia musical education at
the Prague Conservatory and came to this country as
accompanist to Kubelik. After a tour with the violinist
he appeared with success as a concert pianist in
recitals and with the orchestra. He now devotes his
entire time to composition, and is remarkably successful,
having written a number of musical comedies
which have received the unstinted approbation of the
public. "The Firefly," "High Jinks" and "Katinka"
are among his efforts for the stage.
<h4>491 Twilight</h4>
This is an unpretentious piece of much melodic
beauty, which has been admirably transcribed
for the organ. It is an easy-flowing tune which
fits the organ as though made for it.
<h4>585 Melodie</h4>
This melody is in effect a song without words.
It is in a light vein but of splendid workmanship.
In the arrangement of the roll, due cognizance
of the possibilities for color effects has
been taken; the saxophone, flute and violin appearing
as solo instruments, while in the coda
we have a chorus of strings accompanied by the
harp. The roll is charmingly effective from
beginning to end. 
<h4>595 Russian Romance</h4>
This is one of the most popular of the many
well-known compositions by this Bohemian composer.
He has done much in a light vein, but
nothing more deservedly popular than this. It
is full of charming melody and splendidly harmonized.
<h3>FRY, Henry S. 1875-</h3>
Henry S. Fry was born at Pottstown, Pa., April 27,
1875. He is one of the best-known of American organists,
having given over six hundred recitals. He is
very active in the affairs of the National Association
of Organists, having been president of the association
in 1920.
<p>
As organist of St. Clement's, Philadelphia, he has
established an enviable reputation as a service player
as well as a recitalist. He devotes most of his time to
teachmg and to literary work on musical subjects,
being a regular contributor to a number of musical
periodicals. Most of his compositions are in manuscript.
<h4>623 Sicilano</h4>
Few if any unpretentious numbers are in
greater demand for recital purposes than this
bit of dainty writing. It is to be found on the 
programmes of organists, great and small. The
technical requirements are not very great, but
it requires a goodly share of musical instinct to
do it justice. The present roll was played by
the composer and is a charming thing.
<h3>FRYSINGER, J. Frank 1878-</h3>
Concert organist, composer and teacher. Born at
Hanover, Pa., April 7, 1878. He atudied with Frederick
Wolff, Baltimore; S. Camillo Engle, Edgar Stillman
Kelly and Richard Burmeister, New York; Ralph
Kinder, Philadelphia, and W. Wolstenholme, London.
His compositions include about thirty piecea for organ
and over seventy for piano, in many of the accepted
forms. He is at present attached to the University
School of Music at Lincoln, Nebraska.
<h4>495 At Parting of Day</h4>
This is a delightful little bit of sentimentality
which was composed for the organ by a man
who has a highly pleasing gift of melody. The
theme is very graceful and is clothed with most
appropriate harmonies.
<h4>605 At Twilight</h4>
Here is a fine flowing melody with a rather
unusual rhythm. The first theme is in 6-4 time,
and the middle part in 5-4. The second theme
is repeated with a sprightly obligato on the
flutes. All in all, it is a very interesting and
pleasing composition.
<h3>GALBRAITH, J. Lamonte</h3>
<h4>582 Reverie</h4>
As it should be, this is a dreamy sort of thing
pleasantly dreamy. It has rather more form
than most reveries, but is not hampered by it.
It is a really charming piece.
<h3>GAY, Byron</h3>
<h4>454 The Vamp</h4>
Fox-trotting to the "Vamp" is the popular
thing these days. Those among the nimble~
footed who do not succumb to the speU of this
strange bit of music, are a hopeless minority.
Everybody does the "Vamp."
<h3>GILLETTE, James Robert 1886-</h3>
This organist and composer was born at Roseboom,
N. Y., May 30,1886. He graduated from Syracuse
University, where he studied organ with Harry Vibbard,
and composition with William Berwald. He is
at present Professor of Organ and Composition at
Wesleyan College, Macon, Ga. An annual recital tour
has given him wide reputation as a concert organist.
<h4>530 Chanson de Matin</h4>
This is in all essentials like most songs of the
morning. It is melodious and cleverly written.
Its possibilities for unique and interesting registration
will be noted at once and appreciated.
It is a delightful little thing.
<h3>GODARD, Benjamin</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>423 Au Matin</h4>
This is an enchanting little piano piece, which
has been skillfully adapted to the organ with
very satisfactory results. It is in the flowing,
melodious style so characteristic of French composers,
and Godard in particular. It is not a
classic, but is a thing of much charm and beauty. 
<h4>493 Canzonetta from Concerto Romantique</h4>
Here is an almost unequaled example of musical
coruscation. Traveling along with a tune
of unusual brilliance are harmonies of superlative
beauty which continually change with kaleidoscopic
suddenness until one wonders where
this jumping about from key to key will end.
Such a thing could not have been written by
any but a man of very great talent. It has been
said of Godard that he was too easily satisfied
with his own work, but there is in this instance
no evidence of carelessness; there is the evidence
of genius and a real joy in his work. It is beautiful
in the extreme.
<h3>GOUNOD, Charles Francois</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>723 There is a Green Hill Far Away</h4>
This is one of Gounod's most inspired sacred
songs. Nothing could surpass the appropriateness
of the music to the poem. It would seem
almost that they were conceived together. We
have made a delightful organ arrangement of 
this wonderful song which we are sure will
appeal to all admirers of such music. A more
devout or reverential bit of music does not exist.
<h3>GRAINGER, Percy Aldridge 1883-</h3>
The subject of this paragraph was born in Brighton,
Victoria, Australia, July 8, 1883. He received most
of his education at home, from his mother, who also
was his chief instructor in music. He made his debut
as a pianist at the age of ten at Melbourne, Australia.
He later studied with Kwast at Frankfort, and Busoni
at Berlin. He has toured Europe extensively, and his
undisputed genius has met with cordial recognition
everywhere. Among his seventy compositions are
found works in nearly all forms. He is particularly
happy as an arranger of old tunes, which he "dishes up,"
to use a phrase of his own, in most palatable fashion.
<p>
He has resided in New York for the past few years,
and in 1917 enlisted in the American Army. He was
assigned to the band of the Fifteenth Coast Artillery
Corps as saxophonist.
<h4>391 Molly on the Shore</h4>
This number consists of two old Irish Reels,
"Temple Hill" and "Molly on the Shore."
These two tunes have been most ingeniously
woven together into a most charming bit of
music. It is in things like this that Grainger is
best known to Americans as a composer.
<p>
This delightful bit of Irish music is of the sort
that makes one wish for more, especially as the
organ plays it.
<h4>617 Irish Tune from County Derry</h4>
Nothing need be said of Grainger's ability in the
arrangement and harmonization of folk music.
He has done a number of things in a most
charming and original manner. In this instance,
he used a tune of Irish but unknown
origin-nameless even. Grainger got the tune
from "The Petrie Collection of the Ancient
Music of Ireland" and we think Petrie's paragraph,
which accompanies the tune, would be of
interest. We therefore quote it:
<p>
"For the following beautiful air, I have to express
my very grateful acknowledgement to
Miss J. Ross of New Town, Limavady, in the
County of Londonderry-a lady who has made
a large collection of the popular unpublished
melodies of the county, which she has very
kindly placed at my disposal, and which has
added very considerably to the stock of tunes
which I had previously acquired from that still
very Irish county. I say 'still very Irish,' for
though it has been planted for more than two
centuries by English and Scottish settlers, the
old Irish race still forms the great majority
of its peasant inhabitants; and there are few, if
any, counties in which, with less foreign admixture,
the ancient melodies of the country have
been so extensively preserved. The name of the
tune unfortunately was not ascertained by Miss
Ross, who sent it to me with the simple remark
that it was 'very old,' in the correctness of which
statement I have no hesitation in expressing my
perfect concurrence."
<h3>GRETCHANINOW, Alexander Tichonovitch 1864-</h3>
One of the most important Russian composers, Alexander
Gretchaninow, was born at Moscow, October 25,
1864. He studied piano with Safonov at the Moscow
Conservatoire, and composition with Rilmsky-Korsakow
at the Petrograd Conservatoire. His instrumental
works are said to show traces of German influence, but
his church music, of which he has written much, follows
the best Russian traditions. He has written two
operas, two symphonies, three string quartettes and
numerous choruses, songs, etc. 
<h4>551 Meditation</h4>
A very aptly named little piece. It might be an
improvisation. It is formless-just wandering
about, going nowhere in particular, but doing it
delightfully. And when it gets to the end of
its journey, unlike some other things, it stops.
<h4>576 Cradle Song</h4>
Composers great and small have tried their
hands at the song somnolent. Many of these
efforts have resulted in most charming music, as
in the present case. Simplicity is the charm of
this little gem, as it is in all good cradle songs.
<h3>GRIEG, Edvard Hagerup</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>395 Solvejg's Song, Peer Gynt Suite, No.2</h4>
This is a melody of remarkable appeal, and
such a one as only Grieg could have written.
The inspiration was taken from Peer Gynt and
the song occurs when Peer Gynt returns to his
hut in the forest, and finds Solvejg awaiting
him. He dies in her arms as she croons this
beautiful melody. 
<h4>402 March qf the Dwarfs, Op. 54, No. 3</h4>
This is one of a set of lyrical pieces for piano.
It is quite grotesque and a most bewitching bit
of writing. The organ provides the necessary
medium for a most satisfactory rendition.
<h4>596 Berceuse</h4>
Of the many lyrical pieces by Grieg, none is
better known than this Berceuse. Nothing
could be more beautiful, or more in keeping
with its title. It would not be classed as a difficult
thing to play, but it is not without troublesome
spots, which, if not played with consummate
ease and grace, are apt to ruin the effect.
The Estey Organist recognizes none of these
difficulties and the effect is charming.
<h4>597 Norwegian Dance, Springtanz, Elegie, Waltzer Opus 38</h4>
In the set of lyrical pieces comprising Op. 38,
there are a number which are splendidly adaptable
to the organ. One roll, No. 596, contains
the lovely Berceuse from this opus. The present
roll contains four of the most charming
numbers of the set. They are four beautiful
miniatures and are representative of Grieg at
his best.
<h4>604 To Spring, Op. 43, No. 6</h4>
Perhaps none of Grieg's lyric pieces is better
known than this charming little spring song.
In adapting it to the organ, nothing has been
lost; indeed, in spots the organ seems to bring
out the composer's intent better than the piano.
<h3>GUILMANT, Felix Alexandre</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>414 Priere et Berceuse</h4>
This number is of a type of which Guilmant was
particularly fond. He delighted in anything
suggesting tranquillity, and was at his best when
working along lines of simple melody. As a
contrapuntist he was excelled by but few of
his time, but he seemed to take the greatest joy
in allowing his mind to wander along with a
tune of exquisite beauty and refinement. No 
one was ever more fastidious or discriminating
in the choice of subject material than Guilmant,
therefore his themes were always well worth the
work he put upon them in the way of development,
ornamentation, etc.
<p>
The present roll is highly characteristic. It
opens with a very slow movement (Prayer)
which serves as an introduction to a lovely slumber
song (Berceuse), which is uttered first in
simplest fashion and later elaborated upon. A
portion of the slow movement then recurs and
brings the delightful number to a close.
<h4>431 Caprice, Op. 20, No.3</h4>
The serious side of Guilmant is well known and
understood. Here, however, is an example of
whimsicality which would do credit to a Haydn,
and a degree of jocundity wholly unexpected
from a pen so used to recording expressions of
dignity and religious feeling. It is always interesting
to discover a new angle from which a
great man can be viewed, and this delightful bit
of writing will shed a new light on this great
man's personality which will add interest to all
of his compositions.
<p>
It was written for the organ, and the roll gives
it in a manner approached by none but the most
skillful organists. 
<h4>584 Nuptial March</h4>
Here is a glorious march by the inimitable
Frenchman. He was a pigmy in stature, but a
giant in intellect. He never stooped to frivolity,
he was often jovial, frequently humorous, but
his every mood was dignified.
<p>
This wedding march is as fine an example of
march writing as is to be found.
<h4>625 Grand Chorus in March Form</h4>
No better compositions for organ are to be
found than those of the great Frenchman. He
always felt that whatever thematic material he
selected was worthy of painstaking treatment,
resulting invariably in sturdy, wholesome music.
In this instance we have a splendid march,
vigorous and inspiriting, such as only Guilmant
could write. No one knew better than he the
effects possible on the organ, or the way to
obtain them. He was master of his instrument.
<h4>630 Andante con Moto</h4>
This movement was dedicated to Cavaille Coll,
the great French organ builder and friend of
Guilmant. Guilmant has here written some of 
the loveliest of organ music. It is organ music
and nothing else. An arrangement of it for
anything else would profane it. The opportunity
for tone coloring has not been overlooked
in the making of the roll.
<h4>632 Cantilene Pastorale</h4>
This is Number 3 of Opus 15. It is Guilmant
in one of his sprightly moods. By a singular
coincidence it contains a phrase which is identical
with one in Grieg's "Anitra's Dance." This
sort of thing happens much more often among
the classic writers than is generally supposed.
Of course there is no thought of plagiarism
concerning men of this calibre. It simply happened.
This Cantilene is full of charming
melody and harmony woven together in the
usual masterful manner. It is organ music and
the roll does it full justice.
<h4>633 First Meditation</h4>
The theme of this Meditation savors somewhat
of a pastorale. Much of its charm is due to its
simplicity. In the development of the theme,
many delightful incidents occur. It is full of
tone color and is a splendid organ number. 
<h4>637 Marche Religieuse</h4>
From time to time we have remarked on the
masterful workmanship of this great French
organist. He considered any theme of his selection
worthy of the best treatment he was able
to give it. In this instance, he has selected a
theme from Handel's Messiah- "Lift up Your
Heads." Nothing, therefore, need be said in
praise of the theme. The astonishing thing
about this march is the middle part. Suddenly,
after the principal theme has held full sway for
a time, a free fugue enters. It trips along in
most interesting fashion, when unexpectedly,
the first theme reappears with the fugal theme
as a contrapuntal ornament. The march concludes
with the principal theme in massive
chords on the full organ. It is a wonderful
thing on first hearing, but it must be heard
again and again to grasp its full worth.
<h4>649 Largo e Maestoso</h4>
There are people who possess the silly idea that
a great man-a big man-must be big in stature.
This idea is more or less prevalent despite
the numerous cases which may be cited to the
contrary. To prove the erroneousness of such
an idea we need, for our purpose, only to mention
Guilmant (to say nothing of Beethoven).
Here is a sonata, built on the lines laid down by
Beethoven, which is so masterful in theme and
workmanship as to cause the listener to forget
entirely the fact that it is written according to a
definite form. It is a gorgeous piece of musical
architecture.
<h4>662 Finale from First Sonata</h4>
We have already listed the first movement of
this Sonata under No. 649. The pastorale,
which is the second movement, will appear as
No. 676. These two, with the present roll, constitute
the entire sonata. The finale is a tempestuous
allegro, and in marked contrast to the
pastorale which precedes it. It is also in Guilmant's
inimitable style, which is all that need
be said in praise of it.
<h4>676 Pastorale from First Sonata</h4>
Students of Beethoven are familiar with his
fondness for themes of the simplest character.
In his chamber music in particular, he frequently
used four or five notes of the scale in
sequence, either up or down. In the selection
of thematic material this Pastorale reminds us 
of Beethoven. Here we find the theme beginning
with the first six notes of the scale of A
major in their proper order. Later on, we find
the full scale, and more, used. Along in the
middle we hear, most appropriately, a portion
of a fine chorale, accompanied by the shepherd's
pipe. The first theme is then developed and the
close is effected by the use of two complete
octaves of the scale of A major, with the dying
strains of the chorale as an accompaniment. It
is truly a wonderful composition. Anything
more beautiful would be difficult to imagine
and more difficult to find.
<h4>694 Offertoire, Elevation in F, Carol for Christmastide</h4>
The present roll contains three numbers, as
shown above. Our reason for cutting the three
numbers on one roll was that they seemed to belong
together. The Offertory is based on the
two Christmas carols, "Great God" and "Come, 

Shepherds, Awake"; the Elevation on the carol, 

"Shepherds of the Mountains"; the Carol for 

Christmastide on the carols, "Let Us Sing 

Loudly," "Noel," and "Christ Is Born." 
<p>
All three of these numbers display the skill
of the great French composer, and are fine
examples of organ music.
<h4>695 March from the Ariane Symphony</h4>
The French school of composers were all fond
of the march form, none more than Guilmant.
He seemed to find expression in this form for
his pent-up energy. It would be difficult to
conceive a more vigorous thing than this. It is
a delightful example of Guilmant with a free rein.
<h4>709 Lamentation</h4>
Guilmant dedicates this splendid work to the
"memory of my friend, the Abbe Henri Gros,
killed on the plateau of Avron, December 27,
1870 (bombardment of Paris), aged thirty-one
years." Mention of the bombardment of Paris
need no longer take us back to 1870, and this
tribute to Guilmant's friend may with singular
appropriateness be rededicated to others who
met their death in a similar way. Aside from its
historical interest this lamentation is a work of
unusual interest. It is dignified, plaintive, and
reverential, but never doleful or lugubrious. 
<h3>GUION, David W.</h3>
<h4>573 Turkey in the Straw</h4>
What should be said about this old tune cannot
be better said than by the author of the present
transcription. We quote him:
<p>
"'Turkey in the Straw' every American, of
course, knows, but not as I do, for I have danced
to it thousands of times out here (Texas) at
the cowboy dances until I was almost ready to
drop. I do not know why, where, when or hy
whom it was written, but the cowboys and old
fiddlers rather look upon it as their 'national
anthem.' In this concert transcription I have
tried to write it just as I have so often heard it
whistled and played by our funny old fiddlers,
the cowpunchers and cowboys."
<p>
We have adhered strictly to the text as arranged
by Mr. Guion, and have simply fitted it to the
organ with most fascinating results.
<p>
Mr. Guion is an American musician, born in
Ballinger, Texas, in 1895.
<h3>HALSEY, Ernest</h3>
<h4>570 Festal Postlude</h4>
This is a vigorous postlude of conventional type
but much better quality of writing than the
average. It is full of interesting contrasts and 
is a fine number to show the tonal possibilities
of a fine organ. It is characteristic of the English
school of writing and is a splendid example
of dignified organ music.
<h3>HANDEL, George Frederick</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue. Volume 1)
<h4>544 Allegro from Sixth Concerto</h4>
This is the first movement from the Number 6
organ Concerto. For a number of years these
concertos have been somewhat neglected, but of
late seem to be reestablishing themselves in high
places. The music is old-fashioned, but most
things are that are one hundred and eighty years
old, and antiques never go out of fashion, especially
musical antiques.
<h4>666 Sarabande</h4>
The sarabande is an ancient stately dance. Its
origin is a matter of much speculation. Fuertes
says it was invented in the middle of the sixteenth
century by a Spaniard named Zarabanda.
Others attribute it to a Spaniard
named Sarao. 
Sir William Ousley claimed it was of Turkish
or Persian origin, Ser-band.
<p> 

Whatever its origin it enjoyed years of popularity
all through Europe during the sixteenth 

century. To us it seems very unlike a dance 

tune. We cannot deny its musical worth, however,
and it is this phase of it which concerns us. 

<h3>HAUSER, Miska</h3>
Hauser was a very famous Hungarian violinist, born
in Presburg in 1822. When only twelve years of age,
he made a world tour, meeting with the greatest success
wherever he played. In 1840 he toured Germany,
Sweden, Norway and Russia; in 1850, London and
other English cities. From 1853-1858 he visited California,
South America and Australia. In 1860 he was,
feted by King Victor Emmanuel of Italy and the Sultan
of Turkey. His composition, are little known except
a set of Lieder Ohne Worte (Songs Without Words)
which will survive for many years to come.
<h4>705 Wiegenlied</h4>
For many years this little gem has been a
favorite encore number with violinists and the
public. The reason is obvious, for it is a superlatively
beautiful melody clothed with the
simplest and most appropriate harmonies. It is
truly an enchanting thing. 
<h3>HAYDN, Franz Joseph</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>585 Andante from Symphony NO.4, Clock Movement</h4>
A hearing of just a few measures of this delightful
music suffices as an explanation of the
name which it has been given. The ticking of
the clock begins the movement, and continues
almost incessantly throughout.
<p>
After a measure of "tick-tock" a most exuberant
melody fashioned in Haydn's own mould
asserts itself, and the development which follows
is a fair example of Haydn's skill in composition.
It is a charming movement from the
moment the clock begins to tick until it runs
down at the end.
<h4>737 Adagio, Presto, Symphony in D (Clock Symphony)</h4>
In this Symphony, Haydn has revealed his
many-sided nature. In the introduction to the
first movement, the Adagio, we have a sombre
and solemn announcement. It is a proclamation
which seems to foreshadow a theme of
dignified and stately character.
When he comes to the point, however, we find 
we have been fooled. Instead of the expected
theme we have a tune which is nothing short of
waggish-indeed, just the tune one would expect
from a chap who would deliberately cut the
pigtail off a fellow chorister's wig. Away he
rides on this mischievous, sprightly tune, in unrestrained
and irresponsible merriment. Nobody but
Haydn could, or at least did, write
such a tune. Directly he makes a counter-theme
out of the first theme by turning it upside down.
Then the second theme is fashioned out of the
second principal theme-principally by changing
the accent, now the most brilliant polyphony;
by way of development, the most delightful
musical banter and badinage-all so
characteristic of Haydn that it never once occurs
to us that anyone else could have written it.
<h4>738 Minuetto, Allegretto, Symphony in D (Clock Symphony)</h4>
The so-called Minuetto has all the earmarks of a
scherzo. "Grove's Dictionary" says, "When we
come to Haydn the term minuet ceases to have
any meaning." Goepp says, "Haydn's scherzos
always have a strong 'out of school' feeling,
this one especially; only it is a short recess."
Haydn and Beethoven were the only true musical
humorists. 
<h4>739 Finale, Vivace, Symphony in D (Clock Symphony)</h4>
Again we are constrained to quote Philip H. 

Goepp:
<p>

"Strange to say, the Finale (marked Vivace) 

is quite the most serious phase of the symphony. 

Recess is quite over; we are back in school not
to say church-for the violins, like a well trained
choir, are striking up a melody that
sounds much like a good old chorale.
<p>
"Simply stated, without a note of extended
cadence, it is strictly repeated as if to make sure
we know it. It is like the preacher who states
his text with all serious unction, and repeats it,
to give warning of the great sermon which is to
follow. We are sure it is a rondo, mainly because
it is not sonata-form; the cardinal theme,
in its constant rounds, never lets us forget the
text of the sermon. After some playing of
themal phrases, there comes one of those dynamic
passages, where all join to make a noise,
and finally drop exhausted into a cadence;
whereupon the strings, with a little help from
the woods, gently toss about snatches of the
melody, and the rest pitch in again in general
turbulence. At last the strings rehearse the 
theme in really serious manner, with but slight
obligato variation. The rest, too, join properly
and respectfully in singing the hymn in its
original harmonies. Soon comes another of
those terrible phases, another Minore, where
Papa Haydn tries so hard to look fierce, without
anything special to say; merely general muttering,
with the same old faces. We all know it is
only to break the more pleasantly into his own
benignant smile.
<p>
"Here was the fugue, which we knew was coming
from the emphatic way the theme was first
enounced. With such a theme, it could not be
resisted. It begins in the first violins, with the
seconds tripping in obligato behind, before, and
all around, until they finally take up the theme,
and. the violas 'hold the candle.' Best of all is
when the 'cellos come in and the rest all play
about. Of course, the violas have their turn, too.
Finally, the woods make a trial at the theme,
while the violins go on without attending to their
ineffective attempts, and finally run away from
them, on a side path. At last the whole orchestra
joins in the fugue with all possible magnificence
and solemnity, until the last verse, which is sung
once more as at first." 
<h4>729 Adagio, Vivace</h4>
<h4>730 Andante</h4>
<h4>731 Minuetto</h4>
<h4>732 Finale, Allegro Molto</h4>
The four rolls enumerated above comprise the
G major, popularly known as "The Surprise."
It is Number 8 of a set of twelve written for
Salomon of London, but Number 6 of the Breitkopf
and Hartel and other standard editions.
It was written in 1791. The usual short Adagio
is used as an introduction, leading up to the
first theme (Vivace) in 6-8 time. The theme is
as dainty as could be in the beginning, but soon
takes on a more important air and develops into
a masterful piece of writing.
<p>
It is from the Andante, or slow movement of
the symphony, that it gets its name "Surprise."
It starts out most unostentatiously, the theme
being the single notes of the tonic and dominant
seventh chords, accompanied only by a single
bass note. It is first played piano, then repeated
pianissimo. At the end of the repetition, there
is a sudden and unexpected crash of the whole
orchestra.
<p>
Papa Haydn always loved his joke, and he said
to a iriend when writing this movement, "That's
sure to make the ladies jump." It has never 

failed to this day.
<p> 

The plan of the Andante is that of a theme and 

variations of which he was so fond.
<p>

The Minuetto is in Haydn's inimitable style.
In the Finale, we find Haydn in his happiest
vein. He revels in the sort of theme he has
selected. It seems almost mischievous--as
though he were playing pranks on the players
by making them chase each other all over the
place. He has serious moments, however, and
has introduced some very surprising harmonies
in the latter half of the movement, also a rhythmic
surprise in the use (twice) of a grand pause,
or full measure rest.
<h3>HERBERT, Victor</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>692 Kiss Me Again (Waltz)</h4>
This is one of the old favorites which bobs up
every now and again and has a period of popularity
which makes some of the new things in
the way of popular music suffer by comparison.
It is played and sung on the vaudeville stage
perhaps more than any other single composition,
and it always makes a hit. It seems to
have become a necessity. 
<h3>HIRSCH, Louis A.</h3>
Few, if any, composera of popular music are better
known, or have been more successful, than Louis A.
Hirsch. His success would seem to refute the idea that
a man with a claaaical education cannot write popular
music.
<p>
Hirsch was educated abroad, having studied piano
with Guatave Levy and Rafael Joseffy in Berlin. He
studied theory with Max Spicker in New York.
<p>
Among the many musical shows written by him were
"Going Up," "Vera Violetta," "The Rainbow Girl,"
etc. His greatest success is "Mary," and it is by all
odds the most popular musical comedy produced in years.
<h4>554 The Love Nest</h4>
This is by far the most popular song written for
many years. It stands a good chance of outselling
any song of any time. It is from
"Mary," a musical comedy recently produced
in New York, and by three separate road companies.
The reason for its unusual popularity
is not hard to discover, for it has real musical
merit, as well as that elusive something that
makes one whistle or sing it continuously.
<h4>698 Learn to Smile,from "The O'Brien Girl"</h4>
A production with bright prospects for a long
run is "The O'Brien Girl." It has captured
the popular fancy and is a genuine hit. The
tune that you take home is "Learn to Smile," a 
most fascinating thing which is whistled and
sung for days after its first hearing.
<p>
We have arranged it for the organ in true
theatrical fashion for those who like to dance.
<h3>HOGAN, Parke V. 1868-</h3>
Born in Mount Holly, N. J., May 6, 1868. Studied
organ with the celebrated blind organist, David D.
Wood of Philadelphia. Completed his studies of music
and theory at the Philadelphia Musical Academy.
Has been a successful conductor of chorus, orchestra
and light opera. Has written many songs and has
as well composed a light opera. Our patrons will
be interested in a composition from his pen, as it is
well known that he has for several years been the
guiding hand in the arrangement of music for the
Estey Residence Organ.
<h4>429 Minuet in D Minor</h4>
This is an adaptation of a minuet from a string
quartette. The first strain is a rather robust
and vigorous theme in D minor. The trio starts
in D major but restlessly wanders about among
related keys making very short calls and returning
home in time for the da capo. As with all
minuets the first two strains are played again,
finishing on the common chord of D major.
The advent of the F sharp in the final chord is
rather startling, but leaves a good taste in one's
mouth.
<h3>HOLLINS, Alfred 1865-</h3>
This famous organist and composer was born blind. 

He studied first with relatives, then at the Wilberforce
Institute for the Blind. In 1878 he entered the 

Royal Normal College for the blind at Upper Norwood,
where he studied piano with Hartvigson, and 

organ with Dr. Hopkins. He studied later with von 

Bulow in Berlin.
<p> 

At thirteen he played Beethoven's Emperor Concerto 

at Crystal Palace.
<p> 

In 1886, under the guidance of Dr. Campbell of the 

Normal College, he and a quartette of blind players 

toured America. He visited America again in 1886. 

and Australia in 1904.
<p>

His compositions include two concert overtures and 

numerous other pieces for organ, a romance for violin
and piano, several anthems, piano pieces, etc., all 

of which bear the stamp of the true musician. 

<h4>449 Spring Song</h4>
Rarely does one find a more charming bit of
writing for the organ than this Spring Song.
The spirit of spring permeates it from beginning
to end. Birds, buds, flowers, sunshine--all
the beauties of spring are to be found in this
exquisite composition, which is delightful in its
joyous and buoyant mood. 
<h4>451 Concert Overture in C Minor</h4>
The composer of this overture is one of the best known
composers for the organ. He is largely
known, however, for his works in the smaller
forms such as are usually written for church
service. In this case he has given his talents a
free rein and has produced a number for concert
use which is not only interesting but delightful
from beginning to end. The work is
interesting in theme and his thematic material
is developed in the masterful way characteristic
of the composer. In this instance he had much
to say, and said it in a most fascinating manner.
<h4>687 Cantilene in A flat</h4>
An introduction of six measures serves to establish
the rhythm chosen for this composition.
The theme is one of great beauty and simplicity
and the message it brings is one of refined sentiment.
It is one of those rare things which gives
us more than we hear--that suggests beautiful
thought. After all, this is the great mission of music.
<h4>691 Romanza</h4>
This is a charming melody of the type and
quality to be expected from Hollins. The 
theme is one of delightful simplicity and grace
in G major. A second theme in contrasting
rhythm, in the key of G minor, precludes any
possibility of monotony. Now comes a most
skillful development of the two themes together.
The second theme in G minor has been turned
into a major theme and used as a counterpoint
to the first theme in most clever fashion. It is
a most interesting bit of writing and one which
improves on acquaintance.
<h4>693 Evening Rest</h4>
Tranquillity is the text of this dainty musical
discourse. It is Hollins in his best and most
peaceful mood. The accompaniment of the first
part is in sustained chords with a moving figure
in the pedal suggesting the plucked strings of
the basses in an orchestra. After the first verse,
as it were, the theme is immediately repeated an
octave higher. This time the sustained chords
give way to a broken chord harplike accompaniment,
the pedal figure remaining the same.
Now comes a theme of a totally different character,
forming a splendid contrast with the first
theme. Then, in all its simplicity, the original
theme is heard again, a short coda bringing to
a close a very beautiful bit of music.
