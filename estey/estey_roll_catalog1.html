<h3>1.0 THE ESTEY RESIDENCE ORGAN</h3>
Of all the musical instruments produced by man the three most distinguished are the violin,
 the piano and the pipe organ. Of these the violin still remains the instrument of the virtuoso.
 No method of playing it has yet been invented except by the slow and tedious process of
 acquiring technique. It is the instrument of the accomplished musician.
<p>
 But self-playing
 devices have been applied successfully to both the piano and the organ-but with this difference.
 Piano music derives some of its quality from the personality of the player. The touch of human
 fingers has never been exactly reproduced by mechanical devices. In some compositions the piano
 player equals the pianist, but not in all.
<p>
 The pipe organ, on the contrary, is made for automatic
 playing. There is nothing the organist can do with his hands or his feet that cannot be duplicated
 by machinery. When an organ manual is touched the resulting tone is the same, whether the touch be
 hard or soft, slow or quick. The tone continues in the same volume until the key is released.
 Brilliancy, variety and other differentqualities are obtained by other sets of pipes, and these 
 pipes are brought into play by the stops. These stops can be brought on at the proper place by
 mechanical power just as effectively as by human fingers. If the organ music is correctly cut in
 the music roll, with all the stops, couplers and swells operated at their proper places, the most
 delicate ear cannot distinguish between the human organist and the mechanical organist.
<p>
 Moreover,
 there is a quite general belief among musical people that the organ is the greatest musical
 instrument. It embraces all the instruments of the
 orchestra-even the violin and the piano. It approximates the human voice with wonderful
 fidelity. It has qualities which no other instrument has; tones which no other instrument
 produces.
<p>
 Realizing all these things, we set about making this great instrument furnish the
 music of the home. We have been organ builders for several generations. We knew the qualities
 of the organ. We knew its history. It has been installed in homes, great baronial halls, palaces,
 castles in the past. But then it required the services of a resident organist. Nor was it in
 those days so great an instrument as it is today. Bach wrote organ music which could not be
 played upon the organ as he knew it. But he also knew the organ would develop. It has.
 Not only did it develop musically as Bach dreamed. It attained possibilities Bach never dreamed.
 By means of the self-playing device anyone may now play upon the pipe organ Bach's most difficult
 composition.
<p>
 That is why we commenced to build the Estey Residence Organ. In a country like this,
 with its rapidly increasing wealth, its new homes of an almost palatial character being built daily,
 the necessary cost of a pipe organ was negligible when weighed beside its possibilities. Features
 were being added to these homes whose only purpose was to heighten the pleasurable richness of
 living in them, that cost as much as the most complete pipe organ.
<p>
 Our belief has been justified.
 The Estey Residence Organ is more and more becoming a part of the furnishing of the well-appointed
 house. It gives to its proud owner the control of an orchestra-not the passive pleasure of listening
 to a paid professional organist, not the occasional performance of some musical guest, but his own
 instrument that he plays at will, with the satisfying consciousness that what he plays could not be
 excelled by either the paid organist or the obliging guest.
<p>
 This pleasure never palls. The cost of
 the Estey Residence Organ is forgotten while the satisfaction it gives endures. It is in a business
 sense a sound investment. The pipe organ improves with age, and the upkeep is nominal. It becomes a
 permanent part of the home. It will last as long as the house lasts, and it enhances the value of the
 house. In the hands of a skillful architect or designer it becomes a beautiful addition to the music
 room, living room or hall.
<p>

<h3>2.0 MUSIC FOR THE ESTEY ORGAN</h3>

The music listed in this catalogue has been especially arranged with the greatest care for the Estey
 Residence Organ. It cannot be used on any other instrument. The music and the organ are worked out
 together and to fit each other. A corps of competent musicians is constantly at work producing music
 for the Estey Residence Organ and frequent bulletins are issued describing new compositions. From time
 to time additional volumes will be added to this catalogue, with the compositions classified and
 arranged in a convenient manner for easy reference.
<p>
 The compositions are catalogued alphabetically under two headings-by composers and by titles. The
 composers are also arranged in alphabetical order in the body of the catalogue. It has not been thought
 necessary to further classify under character of composition, such as opera, oratorio, especially
 since many compositions fall in more than one class.
 <p>
 The musical library of the Estey Residence Organ will continue to grow, guided partly by the tastes of
 the owners of the organs, and partly by our desire to present an adequate representation of the great
 and wonderful music available for the purpose. When a piece of music has been arranged for the Estey
 Organ at the request of any organ owner, that piece will be put into the bulletin, and subsequently
 into the catalogue, and will be available to any owner who cares for it.
<p>
 In selecting the compositions
 for arrangement, we have tried to cover a range that would meet the varying tastes of lovers of the
 organ, and our plan is to meet individual requirements as far as possible. We are ready to arrange
 any composition which a customer may desire, and this can be done with surprising promptness. We have
 kept in mind music especially suited to the home and such as would provide for almost any occasion, while
 at the same time furnishing a rather unusual opportunity for becoming familiar with the works of the
 greatest composers. Musical compositions can be studied with great thoroughness by the use of the Estey
 Organist, as the themes can be separated from the accompaniment and each studied separately.
 <p>

<h3>3.0 HOW TO PLAY THE ORGAN</h3>

There are three ways of playing every music roll. The first is with no effort on the part of the operator,
 beyond inserting the roll and starting the mechanism. In this way the perforations in the paper bring
 on and change the selection of stops and combinations at the proper places in the composition, and operate
 all the expression devices and the phrasing.
<p>
 With the second method the piece is pJayed with the proper
 stop combinations and expression devices operated by the perforations in the paper, while the operator
 introduces his own ideas of phrasing.
<p>
 A third way permits the operator to use his own selection of registration
 and gives him complete control over all the expression devices except the actual playing of the notes.
<p>
 None of these interferes with the playing of the organ by the hands and feet in the usual way.
<p>
 There is
 nothing intricate or mysterious about the mechanism. It is simply an application of wellproven mechanical
 principles for many years standard with all organ construction, but perfected and refined. A brief
 description of the action is given for information and guidance in order that the owner may clearly understand
 just what is done and why.
<p>
 Select the roll to be played, unfasten the cord, being sure that the paper is tightly
 rolled on the spool, and insert the pin in the left-hand end of the music roll in the spring receptacle at the
 top of the tracker box, letting the right-end pin engage in the slotted chuck at the opposite end of the
 tracker box. With the hand revolve the bottom or take-up roll until the hook in the center groove is in
 front, where the ring on the music can be easily attached. Revolve this roll, pulling off the paper from
 the spool so as to completely cover all of the holes or throats in the tracker bar, being sure that the
 paper is centered on the tracker bar. Then close the glass slide and press the &quot;on&quot; piston marked
 &quot;To Play.&quot; This permits a pressure of wind to enter the closed tracker box. Put the music in
 motion by moving the tempo pointer toward the right. As soon as the number noting the tempo of the
 composition is visible on the music roll, set the pointer on that number. When a perforation in the paper
 comes over a hole or throat in the tracker bar the wind fills this throat and tube leading from it and
 causes a small poppet at the back of the console to lift and complete an electric circuit. From then on,
 the action is that of the hand-and-foot played organ.
 <p>
 At the end of the selection a perforation registers with a throat which controls the reverse mechanism
 and the music roll is rewound. At the same time the wind is shut off from the tracker box and all stops
 and combinations which have been used are cancelled, all parts of the organ remaining at rest. When the
 rewinding is complete, the spool stops and may be removed and another inserted, in the same manner as
 before.
<p>
 When it is desired to operate the stops and ex&middot; pression devices by hand, the piston on
 the right of the tempo plate marked &quot;Stop Control&quot; should be in the &quot;off&quot; position.
 That is, the &quot;off&quot; piston should be down. It should be remembered that the stop controlled
 perforations in the paper are inoperative if this &quot;off&quot; piston is down. Inversely, when the
 paper is to control the registration and expression devices, the stop control piston &quot;on&quot; must
 be down.
<p>
 Never try to open the glass slide when wind pressure is in the tracker box. This wind pressure is
 controlled by the pistons marked &quot;To Play,&quot; &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off.&quot; It will be found
 that the &quot;off&quot; piston is automatically pushed down when the roll is being rewound and when the
 organ is at rest. Care should be taken to protect the tracker box from dust as far as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<h3>4.0 CATALOGUE OF MUSIC</h3>

<h3>BACH, Johann Sebastian 1685-1750</h3>
Leaving the name Bach out of the history of music,
there would be no history of music. This very
numerous family were prominent members of their
profession for a period of nearly two hundred years,
and so closely were they allied with the development
of musical art that the first sentence of this paragraph
becomes a truism. In all history there is not
so remarkable an example of heredity, or so strong a
refutation of the seemingly well-founded idea that
genius never repeats.
<p>
The real musical ancestor of the family was Hans
Bach, who was born about 1580 and died in 1626.
Hans had three sons deserving of mention as musicians.
One of these, Christoph, had three famous
sons, one of whom, Johann Ambrosius, was destined
to become the father of our subject, in whom the
spark of genius grew to a brilliance which is still
undimmed, nay which has grown brighter through the
years. His first lessons were given him by his father,
on the violin. At the age of ten both his parents died.
leaving him and his education in the care of his
brother, Johann Christoph, an organist at Ohrdruf.
The genius of the boy now displayed itself unmistakably,
and he progressed with a rapidity which was
not encouraged by his brother. The use of a valuable
volume of manuscript of Frohberger, Buxtchude and
other celebrated composers was forbidden to the boy,
who surreptitiously obtained it and copied it by moonlight,
spending six months at it. When the stern and
inhuman brother discovered what the youth had done,
he took away from him his hardly earned treasure.
<p>
Bach became a very great organist and was fortunate
in having his genius recognized and appreciated
during his life. His move to Leipzig in 1723 
was one of the most important events in his life, as it
gave him a position where his duties were not so exacting
that he could not devote the necessary time to
composition. He also found a musical atmosphere
which he had not known before. These ideal conditions
undoubtedly helped him produce the great works
of this period, which are among his greatest.
<p>
Many of Bach's contemporaries were skilled in the
art of polyphonic writing, and their work will stand
as exacting scrutiny from a standpoint of workmanship.
It is the musical test, however which places
Bach above all his predecessors and contemporaries.
Schumann referred to Bach as the man "to whom
music owes almost as great a debt as a religion does
to its founder." 

<h4>216 Toccata in F</h4>
Never was, nor will be, a greater toccata written
than this. To say it is the greatest of Bach's, is
the same as saying it is the greatest of all.
Words fail to describe it. It must be heard
not once or twice, but a dozen or twenty times
before its true greatness dawns upon one. It
is great musically, but marvelous structurally,
and worthy the study necessary to fathom its
depths.
 
<h4>270 Gavotte from Sixth English Suite</h4>
Tradition has it that the six English suites were
written for an English patron of Bach's and in 
the absence of any reliable data on the subject,
this guess is probably as good as any that could
be made. Bach wrote some French Suites also.
The Gavotte from the sixth English Suite is a
fine example of a form which was much in vogue
in Bach's time, and a form in which Bach was
especially skillful. The usual Musette is present
and serves as a delightful contrast to the
Gavotte proper.
<h4>284 Gavotte from Orchestral Suite in D</h4>
While the Gavotte is a dance tune of French
origin, Bach's work along this line was in no
way inferior to that of his French contemporaries.
This Gavotte differs somewhat in form
from the general plan, in that there are two
separate Gavottes, the latter one replacing the
Musette. In both forms, however, the first part
is always the concluding part also. 
<p>
<h3>BACHMANN, Georges</h3>
There is very little record available of this composer.
He wrote a large number of piano pieces, many of
which won popularity among lover, of music. He
was born about 1848; died in Paris in 1894
<h4>299 Les Sylphes</h4>
This is a familiar waltz which was very popular
with music lovers of the last generation. It is
delightfully effective on the organ and is full
of grace and charm throughout. 

<h3>BALFE, Michael William 1806-1870</h3>
This writer of so many of our favorite longs was born
in Dublin. May 15, 1808. As early as the season of
1814-1815 he was the capable violinist of the dancing
class of which his father was instructor. At seven
years of age he wrote a polacca and scored it for
Military Band. At the death of his father he became
the pupil of Chas. Edward Horn, a singer. Later
he was engaged to play in the orchestra at Drury
Lane, where he at times led the orchestra. In 1825
he went to Italy under the patronage of Count Mazzara.
Here he studied counterpoint and ringing. also
writing a successful ballet, "La Perouse." In his
twentieth year he visited Paris, and was introduced
to Rossini, who was then director of the Italian Opera.
Rossini soon discovered hia talent and offered him an
engagement for three year, as principal baritone on
the condition that he take a preparatory course with
Bordogni. His first appearance was as Figaro in the
"Barbiere," and was a decided success. From now on
he led a life of great industry, singing the baritone
roles of all the great operas, and comporing at an
astonishing rate. He died October 2O, 1870, leaving
behind a list of twenty-nine operas-twenty-one English,
five Italian and three French.
<h4>380 Then You'll Remember Me</h4>
This is a very well-known number from the
"Bohemian Girl," which is by far the best known
of Balfe's operas. It is a cavatina in form, and
occurs in the third act. It is so well known that
a description is not only unnecessary, but would
not be complimentary to music lovers.
<h3>BALL</h3>
<h4>258 Mother Machree</h4>
Perhaps the most popular of the many Irish
ballads which have been written in recent years. 
<h3>BARNBY, Joseph 1838-1896</h3>
Sir Joseph Barnby was the son of an English organist,
Thomas Barnby. He was bom at York on the
12th of August, 1838, and was a chorister at the age
of seven. In 1862 he was appointed organist of St.
Andrew's. London, and the services at this church
became famous under his direction. He is chiefly
known for his numerous compositions in choral form.
His works include an oratorio-"Rebekah"-and two
hundred and forty-six hymn tunes, which were all published
under one cover in 1897. He was also famous
as a conductor of Barnby's Choir, and later succeeded
Gounod as conductor of the Albert Hall
Choral Society. He died in London on the 28th of
January, 1896.
<h4>237 Sweet and Low</h4>
This is a setting of Tennyson's lines:
"Sweet and low, sweet and low, wind of the western
sea,
Low, low, breathe and blow, wind of the western sea.
Over the rolling waters go,
Come from the dying moon and blow, 

Blow him again to me, 

While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps." 

<h3>BARTLETT, James Carroll 1850-</h3>
This composer of many meritorios songs was born in
Harmony, Maine, July 14,1850. He entered the New
England Conservatory in 1869, where he studied
piano and voice. He became later a pupil of Shakespeare
and developed into a fine tenor. He toured this
country in 1875-1876 with Camilla Urso, and was
later musical director for Booth and Barrett. Many
of his songs occupy a regular place on concert programmes.
<h4>278 A Dream</h4>
A song with a melodious beauty which has
caught the popular fancy, and bids fair to retain
its popularity for some time to come

<h3>BATISTE, Edouard 1820-1876</h3>
Batiste was a very renowned French organist, perhaps
the best of his time. Like most eminent French musicians.
he got his education at the Conservatoire of
Paris. His compositions stand high in popular favor,
but they fall far below what might be expected from
an executant of his unusual ability. He wrote very
little, if anything, except for the organ.
<h4>181 Communion in G</h4>
A melody such as one would suspect had been
written for the organ. It is anything but elaborate
in the beginning, depending solely on the
delightful tune with plain harmonies for its
attractiveness. Then the same subject is
treated with various sorts of ornamentation,
forming a very interesting contrast to the first
part. It concludes with a quiet repetition of
the theme with a slightly different harmonization.

<h4>232 Offertoire St. Cecilia Op. 8 No.2 in D</h4>
This is one of a number of "Offertoires" by
Batiste which have become immensely popular
among organists, especially for concert purposes.
It is a simple melody of great beauty,
which is subjected to much elaboration, not to
the detriment of the melody however, for Batiste
knew when to stop. The present roll
plays this number in a way seldom equaled by
hand playing because of certain technical difficulties
which are of course of no consequence
to the automatic mechanism. 

<h3>BEETHOVEN, Ludwig van 1770-1827</h3>
What can be said in a paragraph of this Titan about
whom literally dozens of whole volumes have been
written? One might venture the opinion that he was
the greatest of all composers with very little chance
of overstating the truth. He invented the sonata
form as we know it, and then wrote symphonies in that
form as if to prove it the greatest and best of all forms.
All the hardships necessary to the development of a
great genius were Beethoven's; he knew the sting of
hunger more than once, and poverty was his portion
for many years. A drunken father and the death of
his mother and sister added to his misery. It may be
that the troubles that were his in early life furnish the
reason for the fact that, as compared with Mozart,
Mendelssohn and others, he wrote practically nothing
of importance until he was twenty-five or twenty-six.
<h4>126 Adagio Cantabile-Sonata Pathetique</h4>
This is a lovely example of wonderful thematic
beauty combined with masterful workmanship.
Like most of Beethoven's themes, it is simplicity
itself; indeed, this is its charm. It is from
one of Beethoven's early sonatas, but a famous
one, "Pathetique." As an effective organ number
it is unexcelled.


<h4>219 Symphony Op. 21-Andante Cantabile</h4>
This is the slow movement of Beethoven's first
symphony, written sometime before April, 1800.
Nothing need be said about the charm of a
Beethoven slow movement, whether it be from
a sonata, string quartette or symphony. In this
style of writing he gave his genius a free rein,
and his wonderful technique of composition
permitted him to put down what many another
man might have thought, but never could have
expressed as Beethoven did.
This first symphonic slow movement gives
many indications as to what might be expected
of him in the future, and his style and individuality
never changed to a point which would
make this movement unrecognizable as Beethoven's
work.
<h4>265 Minuet in G</h4>
This is a lovely unattached minuet which deserves
to belong to a symphony, quartette, or
sonata. It suffers little in popularity, however,
as a result of its not having a "home"; in fact,
it is quite possible it is better known than would 
be the case if it were a part of one of the above
forms. Beethoven wrote it! What more can
be said by way of recommendation.
<h4>322 Andante con Moto (Fifth 
Symphony)</h4>
The Fifth Symphony was begun about 1805 and
had its first production December 22, 1808, at
a concert given by Beethoven consisting entirely
of works of his own which had never before been
heard in public. The affair was a fiasco, due to
the length of the programme, the extreme difficulty
of the music, the intense cold in the unheated
theatre, and an actual breakdown in a
choral fantasie which was one of the numbers.
In spite of such an inauspicious premier performance,
the Fifth Symphony has become perhaps
the most popular of all symphonies. There
is nothing more beautiful in music than a Beethoven
slow movement, and few, if any of his,
surpass this one. The organ roll does it full
justice. 

<h3>BIZET, Georges 1838-1875</h3>
Bizet, whose proper name was Alexandre Cesar
Leopold Bizet, was one of the really great modern
French composers. From 1848 to 1857 he was one
of the most distingmshed pupils at the Conservatoire,
where he studied piano, organ, harmony and composition,
the latter branch under no less a personage Halevy,
whose daughter he married in 1869. He had his share of
disappointments before getting the recognition he deserved.
Carmen, his masterpiece, conquered the whole world.
It was produced first at the Opera Comique, March 3, 1875.
It did not meet with instant success, but its genuine merit
was not to be denied as it won a lasting place among
the standard grand operas.

<h4>345 Carmen Fantasie No.1</h4>
This long roll is a source of delight from beginning
to end. It properly begins with the introduction
to the opera, after which the stately
Toreador Song appears. The principal airs of
the first act follow in about the order in which
they appear in the opera. The wonderful
Habanera; the street boys' chorus; the lovely
air by Michaela; and in fact all the gems of the
first act are included. In this arrangement this
beautiful music is heard at its best, and it would
be difficult to find one to dispute the statement
made in the first sentence of this paragraph. 

<h3>BOCCHERINI, Luigi 1743-1805</h3>
Boccherini was the son of a bass player, who gave him 

his fird musical instruction on the cello. At fourteen 

he was sent to Rome to study, and his progress both 

in playing and composition very soon made him 
famous.
<p> 

In 1764 he returned to Lucca, the place of his birth, 

where he became a member of the theatre orchestra 

and town band. 
<p>
He was one of the most indefatigable composers, and 

despite his great popularity, he died in abject poverty
May 28, 1805.
<p>

The list of his compositions seems incredible. including
as it does 125 quintettes, 91 quartettes, 54 trios, 

all for strings, besides 42 trios for other instruments, 

12 pianoforte quintettes, 18 quintettes for various 

other instruments, 20 symphonies, 2 octettes, violin 

duos, sonatas, cello concertos, and sacred music.
<p> 

He was contemporaneous with Haydn, with whom he 

shares the honor of being the father of the string 

quartette. 

<h4>340 Minuet Celebre</h4>
This minuet is one of the charming bits of
writing so characteristic of the composer. Its
daintiness is its chief charm, though it lacks
nothing in the way of strictly musical worth.
It is perhaps the best-known bit of writing by
this composer. 

<h3>BRAGA, Gaetano</h3>
This composer is a distinguished Italian cellist. He
was born in the Abruzzi and was a pupil of the Naples
Conservatory. He traveled extensively and has made
several European concert tours. Besides compositions
for the violoncello, he has written some operas
and chamber music.
<h4>266 Angels' Serenade</h4>
The popularity of this number has, in many
years, shown no signs of lessening. The theme
is of an appealing sort, and the words contain
a pretty sentiment. Altogether it is a charming
number and one deserving of the popular
approval it has so long enjoyed. 

<h3>BRAHMS, Johannes 1833-1897</h3>
This composer was born in Hamburg, May 7, 1833;
died in Vienna, April 3, 1897. His first instruction
in music was given by his father, who was a member
of the Orchestra of the Stadt Theatre, Hamburg, but
his principal musical training was under Marxsen of
Altona. He made his debut as pianist when but fourteen
years old and shortly thereafter made a concert
tour with Remenyi. the violinist, but it is as a composer
that Brahms is best known. Some of his friends
in their zeal pitted him against Wagner. and precipitated
an artistic battle between the two, which was
distasteful to both. He occupies a place in the
musical world as a master.
<h4>261 Capriccioso</h4>
This is a delightful little thing written for the
piano, and will serve to show the wonderful
effectiveness of the organ in rendering a number
which is so obviously piano music. Its
musical value is really enhanced as a number of
pretty figures which may be lost on the piano,
because of the single tone color, are brought to
the surface-so to speak-on the organ in a
way quite impossible to any other instrument.
<h4>310 Hungarian Dance No. 1</h4>

<h4>311 Hungarian Dance No. 2</h4>

<h4>312 Hungarian Dance No. 4</h4>

<h4>300 Hungarian Dance No. 6
</h4>
Many composers have felt the wild and weird
charm of Magyar (Hungarian) music to the
extent that they were moved to write something
in this style. Some of them, undoubtedly, were
unconsciously obeying certain racial instincts,
while others were simply moved by a care-free
style in which they could give expression in
unrestrained and almost formless fashion to
certain moods which could not be adequately
expressed in strictly orthodox forms.
The peculiarities discoverable in what we know
as Hungarian music are traceable to certain
characteristics in the music of two distinct peoples.
To the Magyars-the true Hungarians-belongs
the rhythm, which is unique because of
its almost incessant syncopation, consisting generally
of the accentuation of the second eighth
note of the measure of 2-4 time. This rhythm
is known as "alIa zoppa" (in a limping way).
The gypsies are responsible for the numerous
embellishments, without which Hungarian

music would not, to us, be Hungarian. These
two qualities have been so intimately linked
together for so long a time that they have
become concomitants and are now inseparable.
Thus it is seen that the gypsies, while enjoying
the honor of being the composers of this charming
music, simply took the real Hungarian
music, added certain ornaments of their own,
and produced what has come to be regarded as
a national style.
In other words, they did what Homer did according
to Kipling:
<p>
When 'Omer smote 'is bloomin' lyre,<br>
'e'd 'eard men sing on land and sea,<br>
And what 'e thought 'e might require,<br>
'e went and took-same as me.
<p>
The market-girls an' fishermen, <br>
The shepherd an' the sailors, too,
<br>
They 'eard old songs turn up again,<br>
But kep' it quite-same as you!
<p>
They knew 'e stole; 'e knew they knowed,<br>
They didn't tell, nor make a fuss,<br>
But winked at 'Omer down the road,<br>
An' 'e winked back-the same as us!
<p>
The Brahms Hungarian dances are standard,
and a description of anyone of them would
serve as adequate comment on all. They possess
all the characteristics, peculiar and otherwise,
of the style, and may be taken as models
of their kind. Number 6 is perhaps the most
popular of the set, but the others are no less
interesting. Their beauties are brought out by
the rolls in an unusually satisfactory manner.
<h3>BREWER, John Hyatt 1858-</h3>
John Hyatt Brewer is a well-known American organist
who began his musical career as a boy soprano,
and served several New York churches in this capacity.
He studied harmony with Navarro and organ
with Buck and others. He is known as a fine organist.
and a capable chorus director as well as a composer
of many works for organ. He has also written
numerous songs, glees, and choral works.
<h4>308 Echo Bells</h4>
This composition has been arranged especially
for a pleasing introduction of the chimes. It is,
however, very effective on organs in which the
chimes are not included, where the effect of
chimes is produced by other combinations. 

<h3>BUCK, Dudley 1889-1909</h3>
Dudley Buck was the son of a Hartford (Connecticut)
merchant, who planned that Dudley should follow
a mercantile life. He discovered his son's musical
ability, however, and showed commendable judgment in
sparing no effort to make of him a musician. Buck
was one of the greatest American composers, and has
left us a rich heritage of compositions in various
forms. While he wrote voluminously for male and
mixed choruses, he did not neglect the orchestra, and
was at one time assistant conductor of the Theodore
Thomas Orchestra. He was for many years America's
premier organist, and wrote much for the organ.
<h4>149 At Evening, Idylle, Op. 52</h4>
It is doubtful if any of the organ works of this
composer has met with the degree of approbation
from musicians and the general public
which this number enjoys. It is beautifully
sentimental, and when one is in the mood to
enjoy a pastoral such as this, nothing could surpass
it in its quiet effectiveness. This American
composer has endeared himself to the public
largely through his anthems, of which he has
written a very large number.

<h4>313 Home, Sweet Home 
(Transcription)</h4>

The authorship of this lovely melody, which we
know by the above name, is much in doubt. It
has been ascribed to Sir Henry Bishop, and to
Thomas Moore. It was published early in the
last century under the title, "To the Home of
My Childhood," and the melody ascribed to
Sicilian origin.
<p>
Sir Henry Bishop used this supposed Sicilian
melody in his opera "CIari," or the "Maid of
Milan," in 1828. Later he confessed to William
Chappell and others that he was the real composer
of the melody. What a condescension!
Incidentally, who would not like to make such
a "confession"!
<p>
It may be said to the credit of Buck, that in his
transcription for the organ he has done nothing
to destroy the innate beauty of the melody, but
rather has woven about it a very pretty figure
of embroidery which serves only to add to the
loveliness of the theme by contrast. 

<h3>CARYLL, Ivan</h3>
<h4>363 Wait Till the Cows Come Home</h4>
This is a number from Jack O'Lantern in which
the comedian, Fred Stone, is the star. As arranged
it is intended as a fox trot, and as such
has become very popular. We believe this roll
will be found to meet all the requirements of
dance music, as it lacks none of the snap of an
orchestral rendition. 

<h3>CHAMINADE, Cecile 1861-</h3>
A brilliant pianiste and a composer of very many
piano pieces highly esteemed for the dainty style so
characteristic of the French school. At eight years
of age her first efforts at composition resulted in some
church music. Since then her writing has been mostly
for the piano, and her pieces have been popularized
by her own playing of them as well as by their inherent
merit. She has also written many songs, and a
number of more pretentious works, but is chiefly
known as a composer for the piano.
<h4>190 Water Sprites</h4>
This is one of a great many beautiful piano
pieces by this prolific composer. It is charmingly
characteristic of her, and is a good example
of the dainty style in which the French
excel. Most delightful effects are easily obtainable
on the organ with this roll, and a surprise
is in store for anyone possessed of the idea that
piano pieces cannot be adapted to the organ.
Compositions for the piano have been successfully
adapted to the orchestra, and what is an
organ but an orchestra?

<h4>301 Scarf Dance, Callirhoe Suite</h4>
The Scarf Dance is the second of four numbers
comprising the Callirhoe Suite for orchestra, a
ballet mst produced in 1888. Like most of
Chaminade's work, its charm lies chiefly in its
daintiness.
After the opening part, which is so well known,
there is a delightful theme of Oriental character
which is in appropriate contrast to the
beginning and adds tremendously to the interest.
The opening part is then used as a conclusion.
To those familiar with this number as
played by the orchestra, this roll will be found
highly satisfactory, while to those who know it
only as a piano piece it will be a revelation. 

<h3>CHOPIN, Francois Frederic 1809-1849</h3>
This composer is known to the world by his piano
compositions. He wrote practically nothing else
except a few songs. His piano compositions, however,
are enough to immortalize him. So important are
they that it would be almost impossible to find a piano
recital programme without one or more Chopin numbers.
Perhaps his waltzes and nocturnes are best
known to the laity, but the mazurkas, polonaises and
ballads are known and played by all great artists.
<h4>116 Funeral March</h4>
This impressive funeral march is from a piano
sonata, Op. 35, and is much the best-known
movement of the sonata. The opening series
of chords are as melancholy as one could wish
them to be, and then the sombreness is well
relieved by the lovely plaintive melody which
forms the trio. The tinge of sadness is as
apparent, however, in the trio as in the opening
and closing movements, which are practically
alike. 
<h3>DEBUSSY, Claude Achille 1862-</h3>
Debussy may be considered the founder of what we
call the modern French school. He is probably the
best-known exponent of the full tone scale, that is
to say, in many of his melodies he makes use of steps
of a full tone, instead of adhering to the diatonic
scale of the key indicated by the signature, which is
composed of tones and semi tones. His work has created
much discussion which has brought no result
except to bring forth very rabid expressions for or
againat it.
<h4>249 "Clair de Lune" (Moonlight)</h4>
One of the lovely piano pieces by this composer,
the exquisite charm of which is largely due to its
simplicity. It is as soothing as moonlight, and
dreamy enough to suit the most exacting
sentimentalist. 
  
<h3>DELIBES, Clement Philibert Leo 1836-1891</h3>
This French composer is best known by his fascinating
ballet music, of which he has written much. He received
his musical education at the Paris Conservatoire,
and eventually became Professor of Advanced
Composition in that institution. A large number of
operas were written by him, and some of them occupy
a regular place in the repertoires of many opera
houses. France has produced no greater writer of
dance music.
<h4>139 Intermezzo-Pas des Fleurs (Naila)</h4>
This is a charming bit of writing of a distinctly
French flavor, and of a style in which Delibes
had no superior.
<h4>155 "Pizzicati" and "Valse Lente" from "Sylvia"</h4>
The two numbers on this roll are from a grand
mythological ballet which was produced June
14, 1876, and any doubt which may have existed
as to Delibes' ability as a dance music
writer were at once dispelled. 
<p>
The first movement is, as its name would indicate,
played by plucking the strings of all the
stringed instruments in the orchestra. This
effect is wonderfully duplicated on the organ
and the result is a charmingly satisfactory
rendition.
<p>
The Valse Lente is one of a type that could have
been written by no one but a Frenchman, and
indeed few Frenchmen could have done it.
Nothing in the way of the grace so characteristic
of this composer is lacking, and as a lovely
bit of ballet music it is unexcelled. 

<h3>DONIZETTI, Gaetano 1797-1848</h3>
This prolific composer was contemporaneous with
Rossini. and while he wrote much of merit and in the
true Italian style of his day, he achieved little in the
way of public recognition until after Rossini, who
was five years his senior, had ceased to compose. His
greatest successes are "Lucia di Lammermoor" which
contains the famous sextette; "Lucrezia Borgia"
and "La Favorita" out of a complete list of
sixty-six or sixty-seven.
<h4>185 Sextette from Lucia di Lammermoor</h4>

It is doubtful if any single piece of music exceeds
this number in popularity. Although
originally written for six voices, so well does it
lend itself to various forms of instrumental
adaptation that it has been arranged in every
conceivable form. It is a particular favorite
with concert bands, when the six parts are taken
by various solo instruments accompanied by
the full band. It is extremely effective on the
organ, and invariably gives pleasure.
<h3>DRDLA, Franz</h3>
One of the most popular composers for the violin is
this Bohemian who was born in Prague. He has spent
about twenty-five years in Vienna, much of this time
being spent as concert master of the Royal Opera
House. He is a very fine violinist, as both his compositions
and position would indicate, and a very prolific
composer of small numbers, the most popular of
which are well known in America. Being only a little
past middle age, much more may be expected of him
in the way of delightful writing, quite equal to the
standard he has set by that portion of his work which
is known in America.
<h4>349 Souvenir</h4>
This is one of the numerous compositions for
violin and piano by this Bohemian violinist.
Incidentally it is characteristic of the school to
which Drdla belongs. The extreme rubato
savors of the Bohemian school, as it does of the
Hungarian school. Altogether it is a charming
bit of writing and the string stops of the organ
give it from this roll in a way that is no less
pleasing than a violin rendition. 

<h3>DUBOIS, Francois Clement Theodore 1837-</h3>
Dubois at an early age left the place of his birth
-Rosney-and went to Paris to enter the Conservatoire,
where he successively took the prizes for harmony,
fugue and organ, later, in 1861, taking the
much-coveted Prix de Rome. His compositions cover
all forms from song to symphony and grand opera.
but he is best known in this country for his organ
compositions.
<h4>229 Cantilene Nuptiale</h4>
This is a very good sample of the delicious
melody of which Dubois is capable. Like
most compositions by this composer, it was
written for the organ, and is extremely effective
as played by the present roll.
<h4>291 March of the Magi Kings</h4>
This is an exceptionally unique bit of programme
music. The high sustained note which
is heard throughout the march is intended to
represent the ever present guiding star. It is
an extremely interesting composition aside
from its programme claims. 
<h4>279 March Heroique de Jeanne d'Arc</h4>
Little, if anything, has been done by this celebrated
French composer that is more interesting
than this March Heroique. Certain programme
effects have been attempted as in the
case of the "March of the Magi Kings"; the
voice of Jeanne being heard at intervals in this
case. It is a delightful bit of writing and meets
all the requirements of discriminating musicians
as well as the lover of music.
<h4>234 Toccata in G Major</h4>
The earliest examples of the Toccata form are
those of Giovanni Gabrieli, 1557-1613. These
examples are rather restricted in form, and seldom
make use of chords even for accompanimental
purposes. The original idea was developed
and elaborated upon from time to time
until Bach placed the form upon the solid basis
which it now occupies. Most composers of
organ music have included one or more Toccatas
in their list, and the present one is deserving
of the popularity it enjoys. Being an organ
composition, it is of course effective when
played from the roll. 
<h4>282 In Paradisum</h4>
This is strictly an organ composition, wherein
the beauty of the theme is more prominent than
its brilliancy. At the beginning the accompaniment
is of a celestial harp. The theme
develops into a choral-like chant, to indicate the
chant of the angels. The harp used in this
composition gives a most beautiful effect.
<h3>DVORAK, Antonin 1841-1904</h3>
This composer has endeared himself to the American
public by his "New World" symphony. After hearing
the negroes of the South sing some of their characteristic
songs, he thought he had discovered the
basis for an American school of composition, and proceeded
to put his ideas into effect. The result is this
wonderful symphony, which is perhaps more popular
than any written in recent years. He wrote it during
his stay in America as the director of the National
Conservatory of New York, and Americans are proud
that such a masterpiece should have been written in
this country.
<p>
Dvorak's theories with regard to the value of negro
music in serious work have been the occasion of much
controversy. A hearing of the symphony, however, is
apt to settle any dispute, and bring about an agreement
that it is highly enjoyable and likely to live.
<h4>175 Humoreske, Op. 101, No.7</h4>
Dvorak has been known to students and attendants
at orchestra concerts for many years. His
New World Symphony endeared him to American
musicians, despite the controversy it created.
The Humoreske, however, is the dainty little
conceit that brought him the recognition of the
masses. It is one of the big little things no one
but a great man could write.
 
<h4>145 Adagio, Allegro Molto. First Movement from New World Symphony</h4>
The fact that this symphony was written in this
country is the occasion of a considerable amount
of pride to Americans. It is a great work, and
whether the claim of the composer to have discovered
in the negro folk song a basis for an
American school of composition is exemplified,
matters not. It can be enjoyed from a musical
standpoint regardless of any opinions one may
have as to its origin. It is enough that the negro
melodies should have inspired so wonderful a
work.
<h4>146 Largo. Second Movement, New World Symphony</h4>
This is thought by many people to be the best
movement of the four comprising the symphony.
The wonderfully sad and plaintive first theme
is doubtless the occasion of this opinion. As a
matter of fact, the other movements are quite as
good, but they are not so obvious-they require
a few more hearings to be understood. Nothing
could excel the first theme of this number, however,
which in the orchestra is an English horn
solo for four measures, then it continues as a
duet with the clarinet. Presently the strings
have it for eight measures, when the English
horn takes it up again with the bassoon. The
French horns lead up to the second theme which
is in strong contrast, paving the way for a reentrance
of the first theme with which the movement
finishes.
<h4>147 Scherzo. Third Movement, New World Symphony</h4>
Scherzo is an Italian word, meaning "jest,"
therefore a scherzo is a composition of a sportive
and playful character. One playing of this roll
will suffice to show how well Dvorak has caught
the jesting spirit. Here and there he stops his
chatter to sing a plaintive little tune for which
the ear is wholly unprepared, but which is no
less welcome or beautiful on that account, returning
to the funny part of his musical story
only to interpolate another contrasting tune.
Then the story closes after a fine working down
from the climax to a scarcely audible pianissimo,
with a crashing chord by the full orchestra. 
<h4>148 Allegro confuoco. Fourth Movement, New World Symphony</h4>
No less interesting than the others is this last
movement of the New World Symphony. At
the tenth measure begins the principal theme of
the movement, a theme big and broad, and well
adapted to the thematic treatment it is to receive
later on. Presently the second theme is heard
in the strings with wood wind accompaniment,
after which portions of both are developed in a
most fascinating manner. An interesting feature
is the curious introduction into this movement
of parts of both the Second and Third
Movements. They are heard distinctly at about
the middle of the roll and near the end. Truly
this is a fitting finale to a great work, an example
of wonderful workmanship, and destined to
become a classic.

<h3>ELGAR, Sir Edward 1857-</h3>
This remarkable composer, the son of a fine organist,
was born at Broadheath, June 2, 1857. His musical
proclivities asserted themselves early in life, and
before he was fifteen he had often substituted for his
father at the organ. A plan to send him to Leipsic
failed, and Elgar's musical education was thrust upon
him by a series of circumstances which, in all probability,
broadened his musical vision to an extent that
would have been impossible had he followed a strictly
ordered course of study. There is scarcely an instrument
in the orchestra that he did not learn to play,
the wonderful color effects of his orchestral writings
being undoubtedly due to his unusual practical knowledge
of each of these instruments. A list of his compositions
includes nearly all the accepted forms, done
in a very charming but generally very informal way. 
<h4>287 "Pomp and Circumstance"-Op. 39, No.1 (Military March)</h4> 
Of all the marches under this title, of which
there are six, none matches its name better than
this one, in D. Its pompous beginning and
ending are wonderfully contrasted with the
imposing middle theme, which is of the kind
that makes one's feet keep time whether he
will or not.  
<h4>365 Salut d'Amour</h4>
There has probably been nothing written in
recent years of really good quality which has
caught the popular fancy to the extent that this
little love song enjoys. It is played as a violin
solo, cello solo, and is an indispensable part of
every organist's repertoire. It can be heard to
no greater advantage than on the organ, and
this roll does it in a way superior to the best
hand-played rendition. 
<h3>FAURE, Jean-Baptiste 1830</h3>
Jean-Baptiste Faure was born in Moulins, January
15, 1830. His father was a singer, and the son followed
his footsteps. He has written several songs, of
which The Palms is best known, and some books of
instruction in the art of singing. He created many of
the baritone parts in the operas written during the
time of his public activity, which ceased about
1878-1880. 
<h4>33l The Palms</h4> 
This is much the best known of the several songs
by this composer. It has become a part of the
Palm Sunday service in most churches and furnishes
an opportunity for the di~play of a fine baritone
voice such as is found in few songs
<h3>FLAGLER, Isaac Van Vleck 1844-1909</h3>
Was born in Albany, N. Y., May 15, 1844. He
studied music first in his native city and then in
Paris with Edouard Batiste. He occupied important
positions as organist after his return to this country,
in Chicago, Poughkeepsie, Albany and Auburn. He
also taught music in the Syracuse and Cornell universities
and at the Utica Conservatory. He composed
and collected considerable organ music, which
is held in high esteem. He died in Auburn in 1909.
<h4>290 Serenata</h4>
This is just such a melody as the name would
indicate, and one characteristic of this wellknown
American organist. 
<h4>289 Impromptu</h4>
A dainty thing, replete with lovely harmonies
and charming melody. It is lacking of any
particular form, but no less interesting on that
account. 
<h4>275 Gavotte</h4>
A pleasing example of an old dance form. It
is tuneflll and is not lacking in the swing so
characteristic of this form. 

<h3>FLOTOW, Friedrich Freiherr von 1812-1883</h3>
His father intended him to enter the diplomatic service,
but like many another father, he was disappointed.
The boy had something in him that precluded
any other pursuit than music. Music was at
its best in Paris in 1827, the time of Flotow's first
visit to that city, and the artistic life which surrounded
him brought him to a realization of his own
musical talent. He began to study with Reicha. He
remained in Paris until the revolution of 1830 drove
him away. He could not stay away long, as he found
the gay life of Paris a necessary stimulus to his work.
He wrote about twenty operas, of which practically
only two, "Martha," and "Stradella," are known to
the present generation. 
<h4>198 Overture to "Martha"</h4>
This tuneful overture to Flotow's most popular
opera has since its first performance in 1847
been a favorite with the public. While it possesses
merit to those inclined to look below the
surface, it is its melodious quality which endears
it to the public. Martha and Stradella, out of
nearly twenty, are about the only Flotow
operas ever produced now. These two, however,
are destined to enjoy many more years of
popular favor. 
<h4>314 Overture to Stradella</h4>
This opera was first performed at the Palais
Royal Theatre in Paris as a lyric drama. Flotow
then recomposed it as a grand opera and
produced it at Hamburg, December 30, 1844,
as "Alessandro Stradella." The overture is particularly
tuneful, and is perhaps as well known
as the Overture to Martha by the same composer.
The first part is one of the most dignified
of Flotow's efforts, and is better known
than the rest of the overture, being much used
as an organ voluntary.
<p>
Taken in its complete form as we have it on the
roll, it is one of the best of the lighter overtures.
<h3>FRANCK, Cesar 1822-1890</h3>
Cesar Franck was a Belgian by birth but a Frenchman
by choice and adoption. After his studies at the
Paris Conservatoire he returned to his native country
for the short period of two years, then moved his
family to Paris where he established himself permanently
in 1844. His unusually strong constitution
permitted him to work at a pace that few men could
have equaled. Day after day he gave ten lessons of
one hour each, beside laying the foundation for the
enormous amount of composing he was to do later in
life. He was a most kindly and lovable man, and
lived his life for his music and his friends, always too
busy to give any attention to the unkind criticism of
his musical enemies, of whom he had many. He was
the chief exponent of a new school of composition, and
he cared little what was said about any of his work
that passed his own exacting scrutiny and had the
approval of his small but very select coterie.
The very large number of compositions he left include
all the established forms; Symphonies. Oratorios,
Symphonic Poems; Cantatas, Biblical scenes, Operas
and Chamber music, numerous pieces for the organ,
piano and songs.
Much of this charming music is unknown to the public.
but it bids fair to come into its own. The gorgeous
Symphony in D minor now occupies the place on
orchestra programmes which it deserves, and organists
are discovering that they have overlooked much
that is worthy of their attention. Surely a very high
place among the composers belongs to this man, and
before many years his name will occupy the exalted
position it deserves. 
<h4>356 Andantino</h4>
Here is an example of unadorned beauty. The
simplest of themes is used and the whole structure
stands solely on its innate loveliness. Of
course it could not be expected that a master
contrapuntalist such as Franck was, should
eliminate all evidences of his marvelous technique
of composition, but he has resorted to so
little in the way of development or ornamentation
that the result is all the more surprising.
It is an altogether lovely bit of writing, such as
only a man of Franck's character could have
done. 
<h3>FREY, Hugo</h3>
<h4>364 When You Come Back</h4>
This is one of the most popular of the many war
songs which are in vogue just now. The present
arrangement is a one step, and is very popular
as a dance number. The composer is leader
of a well-known New York dance orchestra and
has written a number of things which have
caught on with the public. 
<h3>GERMAN, J. Edward 1862-</h3>
German is considered by many to be the successor of
Sir Arthur Sullivan. His remarkable gift of melody
and his ability to clothe his catchy themes with appropriate
harmony have won for him a lasting place in
the musical world. He has written a number of suites
of incidental music to Shakespearean plays which have
excited a wide interest. Two symphonies occupy an
important place among his longer works.
<h4>158 Country Dance-Nell Gwyn</h4>
One of three dances from the music to "Nell
Gwyn," which was first produced in London in
1900. German is one of the best-known English
composers and has given us here a dance of
remarkable grace and freshness, and strikingly
characteristic of his ability.
<h4>335 Shepherd's Dance</h4>
<h4>334 Morris Dance</h4>
<h4>326 Torch Dance</h4>
The music which German had composed for
Richard Mansfield's production of Richard III 
was of such a superior quality that when in 1892
Sir Henry Irving presented Henry VIII, German
was commissioned to write the incidental
music. The result is quite equal to the first
effort, and we present here three dances which
have become famous as concert numbers, and
justly so. They are all charming numbers, and
the organ is the ideal instrument for their performance.
<h3>GIBSON, Archer 1875-</h3>
Was born in Baltimore and received his early instruction
at home. He later studied piano and organ
under Harold Randolph at the Peabody Conservatory
in that city. After holding important positions
in Baltimore. he went to New York in 1901, becoming
organist at the Brick Presbyterian Church on Fifth
Avenue. He devotes his entire time at present to
concert work and is probably the most brilliant of
American organists.
<h4>268 Elegy</h4>
The sadness of this melody is one of its greatest
charms. It is heard at the beginning and
after a lovely middle part, which is in great
contrast, the first theme is again heard, clothed
with the same harmonies, but on a different solo
stop. The change thus effected comes to a
fitting close, completing a very charming number
<h3>GODARD, Benjamin 1849-1895</h3>
This French composer has enriched our musical heritage
by many works of extreme beauty and refinement.
His chief work is the "Damnation de Faust," which
betrays his mastery of orchestration. Most of us
know him best by his songs, and pieces in shorter form
for piano, violin, etc., in which his wonderful gift of
melody is a striking characteristic. A number of
operas and symphonies, as well as other larger works.
are better known in Europe than in America.
<h4>170 Berceuse from Jocelyn</h4>
Comparatively few of the thousands of American
admirers of this lovely lullaby are aware
that it is an excerpt from an opera. Such is the
case, however, and it is a fine example of the
composer's ability along lyric lines. It has the
sentimental quality which sings itself into one's
soul, and has become the great favorite it is by
force of sheer merit.
<h4>308 Solitude</h4>
The title of this number is apposite enough in
so far as the first and last parts are concerned,
but the middle part is apt to suggest anything
else than Solitude. For instance, it might suggest
the ponderous footsteps of an elephant in
the jungle, and the chattering of a lot of
monkeys. Or it might serve well to depict a
cave full of gnomes and bats,-a dark stage,
villains, etc. After all, what's in a name? This
is a charming bit of music and will doubtless
suggest a different thought to each of its
hearers.
<h3>GOLDMARK, Karl</h3>
Goldmark early gave promise by his violin playing.
He was sent to Vienna in 1844 to study in earnest.
The work which brought him seriously before the public
as a composer was the overture, "Sakuntala."
His "Queen of Sheba" is the greatest of his operas.
Goldmark's complete mastery over every musical
effect, together with his wealth of melody, makes his
works altogether charming.
<h4>226 Overture, "Sakuntala"</h4>
At the first production of this overture in
Vienna, the public realized that a new star had
arisen. The overture is founded on a Sanskrit
drama, and the story has to do with the gift of
a ring by the King to Sakuntala by which she is
to be recognized as his wife. She loses the ring
while washing clothes in the sacred river, and
when presented to the King he repudiates her
because of the absence of the ring. Some fishermen
find the ring and return it to the King who
then remembers Sakuntala, and is filled with
grief and remorse. He finally finds Sakuntala
again, and the joy of both is complete. 
<h3>GOTTSCHALK, Louis Moreau 1829-1869</h3>
This perhaps most famous American pianist was born
in New Orleans of an English father and a French
mother. He studied the piano merely as an accomplishment
until the age of twelve, when he prevailed
upon his parents, who were in easy circumstances, to
allow him to go to Paris to take up music seriously.
When financial reverses overtook his father, he turned
his talent to good account, and traveled eztensively
giving concerts. He was the idol of many countries,
including his own. No other pianist has traveled as
eztensively or played to as many people. He died
suddenly in Rio de Janeiro.
<h4>172 Last Hope</h4>
This composition is said to have been played by
Gottschalk extemporaneously at the request of
his benefactress, Mme. S---, who, mourning
the absence of her only son, and being afflicted
with an incurable disease, could only forget her
suffering in listening to the playing of her dear
Moreau. "In pity, my dear Moreau, one little
melody, the last hope."
<p>
It is upon this lovely composition that Gottschalk's
fame as a composer rests. The theme
has been adapted to church uses by its arrangement
into a hymn.
<h3>GOUNOD, Charles Francois 1818-1893</h3>
Gounod may be said to have inherited his talent, as his
mother was a distinguished pianiste. In 1836 he
entered the Conservatoire, and in 1837 wrote a cantata
which brought him the aecond prize. He became
an organist and his experience with choirs is doubtless
responsible for his fine choral writing. His naturally
refined disposition ahows in all his works, and
he rarely wrote anything below a certain dignified
atandard which he seems to have aet for himself.
"Faust" is his best-known work, and one of the very
best operaa ever written. It ia tuneful and dramatic.
and in fact is of a style which might be advantageously
emulated by some of his auccessors.
<h4>127 Ave Maria</h4>
The first prelude of the Forty-eight Preludes
and Fugues of Bach is used as an accompaniment
to a wonderful melody to which Gounod
has set the Ave Maria. So wonderful is this
combination that mention of an Ave Maria is
generally taken to refer to this one. Indeed,
great as is the prelude, it is known to comparatively
few people in any other form than as the
accompaniment to Gounod's great melody. It
is known to most hearers as a soprano solo with
violin obligato and piano accompaniment.
This roll will be found to bring out the beauties
of the imitation of the voice part by the
violin in most satisfactory manner. 
<h4>156 Serenade-Sing, Smile, Slumber</h4>
A tenor solo, originally, this charming song has
been arranged for all sorts of combinations of
instruments. It is a musical setting to a poem
by Victor Hugo, which follows:
<p>
When thou singest while nestling at eve close by my side,<br>
Dost thou know what my soul unto thine would fain confide?<br>
Thy sweet voice wakes the mem'ry of days render'd joyful by thee.<br>
Ah! then sing, ah, sing, my fair one, then sing, still sing to me.
<h4>214 "Sanctus" from St. Cecilia Mass</h4>
This lovely number is from one of the many
religious works which came from Gounod's pen
in the latter years of his life. After having
for many years written almost nothing but
opera, in which he was very successful, his whole
trend of thought seems to have been changed,
and the dramatic instinct, which he had worked
long to develop, became subordinate to the religious
fervor which characterizes almost all his
compositions for the twelve years preceding
his death.
<p>
This Sanctus is a tenor solo with chorus, and
is delightfully effective on the organ. 
<h4>230 Nazareth</h4>
Nazareth is one of the songs which could have
been written by no one of a less refined nature
than Gounod-not to say, of a less religious
nature. One familiar with his work could almost
identify any of his sacred songs by the
unmistakable religious fervor which permeates
their whole structure.
<h4>293 Marche Romaine</h4>
This is a fine example of march rhythm of the
kind which makes one's foot keep time. It is
both pompous and dignified and never anything
but musical.
<h4>305 Funeral March if a Marionette</h4>
At the commencement of this composition, it is
supposed that two of the doll actors have had
a fight, in which one of them has been killed.
The others sorrowfully mourn the fate of their
companion and organize a party of pall-bearers,
who shall carry their friend to the cemetery.
The procession sets forth and on the road the
troupe converses about the vicissitudes of life 
and reflects sadly that it required but one hard
blow on the nose to knock the breath out of so
talented an artist. As the weather is exceedingly
hot, some of the troupe begin to find the
way long and tiresome and they stop at a wayside
tavern. They remark to each other that it
is not the duty of the living to die for the dead,
and in order to enable them to bear up, they
must partake of soothing and refreshing fluid.
Meanwhile they get into a discussion as to the
merits of their late companion and in the heat
of discussion, they forget that the funeral procession
has now reached the gates of the cemetery.
They finally decide to join, avoiding all
appearance of undignified haste. They fall
into their places and enter the cemetery to the
same phrase as the one at the beginning of the
march.
<h4>355 Selections from Faust</h4>
To many people Faust is the only music by
which Gounod is known, and while these people
have missed much that is good, it may be said,
perhaps without successful contradiction, that
they are familiar with the best of Gounod's
compositions. Indeed, they are familiar with
some of the finest music ever written. The  
present roll includes the Introduction or Overture;
the apparition of Marguerite at the spinning
wheel; the Kennesse; Siebel's Song;
"Gentle Flowers"; the "King of Thule"; the
Jewel Song; Soldiers' Chorus, etc., embracing
nearly all the popular and best-known numbers
in the work.
<p>
Faust is one of the operas which never grows
old, and this roll is a source of delight to all who
hear it.
<h3>GRIEG, Edvard Hagerup 1843-1901</h3>
Grieg's talent was early fostered by his mother, who
was a talented amateur, and from her he got his first
lessons. He began to compose at nine, and on the
advice of Ole Bull was sent to Leipsic in 1858, where
he remained until 1862 under Hauptmann, Richter,
Reitz, Reinecke, Wenzel and Moscheles. His natural
ability, which was very great, could not help but
develop under the guidance of such an array of teachers.
On his return to Norway, the national instinct asserted
itself and the rest of his life was practically devoted
to the fostering of a Norwegian school of music. He
has left many works which must endure, including
nearly all the accepted forms.
<h4>181 Morning Mood-Peer Gynt Suite</h4>
The attention given this suite by concert orchestras
would lead to a conclusion which is
very generally accepted-that it was originally
written for orchestra. Such, however, is not
the case, for the incidental music to the Ibsen
play first appeared in the form of a pianoforte
duet. Certain numbers of it were selected by
Grieg and turned into two suites for orchestra.
The suites are known as Peer Gynt No.1, and
Peer Gynt No.2. It is from Suite No. 1 that
this roll is taken, and the organ will be found to  
produce this music in all its loveliness. It is
intended to musically represent daybreak on an
Egyptian desert. The climax of ever increasing
tone may be supposed to indicate the
increasing daylight.
<h4>183 Anitra's Dance-Peer Gynt Suite</h4>
One does not need to be told that this is an
Oriental dance. It breathes the Orient in every
measure. With this graceful, sinuous dance,
Anitra fascinates Peer Gynt, after first having
made a slave of him by her charms, and they
agree to fiy to the desert together.
<h4>184 Death of Ase-Peer Gynt Suite</h4>
The remarkable harmonies in this number are
inexpressibly charming and weird. It is a
funeral march somewhat different from the
accepted form, as it lacks the middle part or
trio. No combination of instruments could
possibly render this number more effectively
than the organ. One might think it was
written for the organ. 
<h4>182 In the Hall of the Mountain King-Peer Gynt Suite</h4>
Peer Gynt forsakes his stolen bride and wanders
about the mountains, straying into the hans
of the Mountain King where the gnomes tease
and torment him until he is driven out. The
opening of this number is quaint, mysterious
and subdued. It increases in both tempo and
power from the very first measure until at the
end it becomes a surging riot of sound. 
<h3>GUILMANT, Felix Alexandre 1837-1911</h3>
This aon of a Boulogne organist displayed his ability
so early in life that at sixteen he held an important
engagement. In 1871 he moved to Paris to take the
appointment as organist in Trinite, a position which
he held until 1901. As a composer he is known almost
solely by his organ works, of which there are many,
includitng a symphony for organ and orchestra, seven
sonatas and numerous concertos.
<h4>186 Offertory on Two Christmas 
Hymns</h4>

This composition proves Guilmant no less
capable as an arranger than as a composer.
These two old hymn tunes have lost none of
their original charm as a result of their treatment
in this manner. Guilmant's painstaking
workmanship is well exemplified in this number,
and being a composition for the organ, it is an
especially charming roll.
<h4>233 March Funebre et Chant Seraphique-No. 17</h4>
This is one of the best-known organ compositions
by one of the very great organists of the
world. Guilmant played it many times in this
country and gained for it the popularity it 
justly deserves. It is peculiarly organ music
and of the type which permits the organ to proclaim
itself the king of instruments.
<h4>262 Elevation, in Ab</h4>
This impressive composition designed to accompany
the ceremony of the elevation of the
Host, is one of this famous organist-composer's
best-known works. He has chosen that the uplifting
character of the music be displayed by
a fervid theme. He has designed the work that
it be rather free from complexities, both of
structural as well as of harmonic nature. This
beautiful melody makes its greatest appeal
simply, betraying at every measure the sincere
depth of religious thought in the mind of the
composer when it was conceived. This number
is very effective on the organ.
<h4>285 Pastorale</h4>
This form is one which is not unusual in Guilmant's
compositions, and one in which he
showed particular skill. The present Pastorale
was written for harmonium and piano and its
successful performance from a roll entails very
exacting conditions. We must have the sustained
harmonies of the harmonium, and the
broken chords of the piano, and it is surprising
to observe how satisfactorily the organ fulfills
all the requirements. This roll leaves nothing
to be desired.
<h4>288 Grand Chorus in D-Op. 18, No.1</h4>
This roll will bring to many a vivid recollection
of the composer's own playing of this great
composition. Guilmant was small in stature,
but he could conceive big things, and no better
testimony is needed than a hearing of this roll.
The first theme is given out in massive chords
which are tremendously assertive, giving way
later to a playful mood, which furnishes a wonderful
contrast, and prepares one for a reiteration of
the first part which is no less interesting
as a finale than as an opening theme.
<h4>304 Finale (Grand Chorus in 
Eb)</h4> 

Guilmant's conception of a Grand Chorus is
well indicated in this example of the composer
at his best. It is magnificently imposing and 
shows the composer to be the great workman
that he was. The thematic material is good
enough, but it is largely what he has done with
it that makes it the glorious composition it is.
It was, of course, written for the organ, which
means that the roll does it full justice.
<h4>296 Torchlight March-Op. 59, No.1</h4>
This is an unusual type of march, which begins
so pompously that it would seem impossible to
get down to the sentimental theme of the trio.
The contrast is not so great, however, as to
be inappropriate, or unenjoyable. The first
theme recurs after the trio, for a brief moment,
when a new theme is announced. Then as a
finale we find the first theme much elaborated,
and a brilliant coda. 
<h3>HANDEL, George Frederick 1685-1759</h3>
Handel was born in Halle, Lower Saxony, and was
contemporaneous with Bach, both having been born
in the same year. Nothing short of a volume could
contain the merest mention of the incidents in Handel's
life, to say nothing of a description of the influence
and beauty of his works. As a prolific and rapid
composer he had no equal. He wrote "Rinaldo" in
fourteen days, and that gigantic masterpiece, "The
Messiah," in twenty-four days. He is said to have
improvised on paper. He spent many years in England,
and wrote many of his greatest works in that
country. Indeed, there has lately arisen a controversy
between England and Germany as to whether
he was an English or German musician, Germany laying
claim to his birth, and England to his works.
<h4>182 Hallelujah Chorus</h4>
This marvelous chorus is known to everyone.
No other chorus approaches it in stupendous
conception, and it is generally conceded to be
the greatest of all choruses. Handel is said to
have remarked that when he wrote it "he
thought he saw Heaven opened and the great
God himself."
<h4>188 Largo from "Xerxes"</h4>
This dignified number is one of a more or less
lengthy list of pieces without which no catalogue
would be complete. Few are the people who
have not heard it in almost every possible form
except the original. It appears in the opera
"Xerxes" as an aria, but is played as a solo by
every sort of instrument from a trombone to a
violin. In no form, however, does it display its
grandeur to as good advantage as on the organ.
The dignity and delicacy of the organ are particularly
adapted to the happy rendition of this
the only number of the opera now heard.
<h3>HARKER</h3>
<h4>252 In the Twilight</h4>
This is a lovely little organ piece, and is one of
many equally pretty numbers by the same composer.
<h3>HAYDN, Franz Joseph 1732-1809</h3>
The career of Franz Joseph Haydn was not unique
in that he began life as a "poor devil"-to use his own
phrase-and ended it in affluence. We have grown
almost to assume that a very great man could begin
life in no other way. Indeed this is the measure of
true greatness.
<p>
Haydn's birth was exceptionally timely; Bach and
Handel were waning, and but for Haydn there would
have been no one to continue their wonderful work
until the advent of Mozart. He bridged the gap
between Bach and Handel, who were contemporaries,
and Mozart. It is doubtful, too, that we should have
had the Mozart we know, but for Haydn.
<p>
John Mathias Frankh, a schoolmaster and relative
of the Haydn family, on recognizing young Haydn's
talent, prevailed upon his parents to allow him to
take the boy with him to Hainburg that he might
educate him and teach him music. His mother gave
her consent reluctantly, as she had hoped her boy
might study for the priesthood. At eight years of
age he had learned all the music his benefactor was
able to teach him, and went to Vienna to sing in St.
Stephen's Cathedral, where he was taught Latin, reading,
writing, arithmetic and music, and given his
board, lodging and clothes for his services. After
some years his voice began to break, and the choirmaster,
wanting an excuse to dismiss him, seized with
avidity upon the opportunity furnished by Joseph
himself when he cut off the pigtail of a fellow chorister
with a pair of scissors. He was soundly flogged
and dismissed.
<p>
In 1753 Haydn became accompanist for Porpora, a
famous singing teacher, and from this time until his 
death opportunity smiled upon him. He was engaged
by Count Morzin to conduct his private orchestra.
Here he wrote the first of his one hundred and twentyfive
symphonies, and various other concerted works.
Prince Esterhazy engaged him when it became necessary
for Count Morzin to disband his orchestra,
and he remained in Esterhtizy's employ for thirty
years, during which time he composed most of his
quartettes and symphonies.
<p>
We are indebted to Haydn for many of the musical
forms in general use to-day. The sontata, the
symphony, and the quartette as we know them to-day,
are essentially as he left them. They have all been
elaborated, but in none of them has the form undergone
any change of a radical nature.
<h4>227 With Verdure Clad-"Creation"</h4>
The work in which this aria occurs was begun
in 1796 when Haydn was sixty-four, and finished
in 1798. The work in its entirety is one
of the most stupendous compositions for voices
and orchestra extant.
<p>
The present aria is of florid style and will
always be a favorite with lovers of oratorio. It
is for soprano voice and well displays Haydn's
ability to write in the florid style peculiar to
this voice.
<h4>316 "The Heavens are Telling" ("Creation")</h4>
The first performance of the "Creation," from
which this wonderful chorus is taken, was given
in private at the Schwarzenberg Palace on
April 29, 1798, and in public on March 19,
1799, at the National Theatre, Vienna. If
ever a work was inspired it was surely this stupendous
oratorio. Haydn said : "Never was
I so pious as when composing the Creation." 
<h3>HENSELT, Adolf von</h3>
Adolf von Henselt was born in Bavaria in 1814. He
was a celebrated pianist and was well known as a composer
of some very interesting studies for the piano.
He was Official Court Pianist to the Empress of Russia
and was Instructor in Music to the Princes. He
died in 1889.
<h4>307 If I Were a Bird</h4>
This melodious study was named by the author,
"If I were a bird, to thee I would fly," and
throughout the entire composition there is indicated
the spirit of unrest. The composition
indicates clearly the sentiment of longing and
at one point rises to an impressive climax. After
a pause, composure is regained and a flitting
melody is again heard, but this time the impatience
is subdued. Nothing is lacking to make
this a pleasing number. 
<h3>HERBERT, Victor 1859-</h3>
We, in America, have come to feel that Victor Herbert
belongs to us, so great have been his musical activities
among us. He was born in Dublin, Ireland. His
father dying when he was seven years old, his mother,
a daughter of Samuel Lover, the novelist, went to
Stuttgart to live. Here Herbert entered the Conservatory
and chose the violoncello as his instrument.
He came to New York in 1886 and became associated
with Anton Seidl as solo cellist and assistant conductor.
He has written much in the way of light
operas, and short pieces for various instruments, as
well as a number of more serious works.
<h4>267 Badinage</h4>
This is a playful conceit of a kind that no one
writes better than Herbert. The tempo rubato
is characteristic, and it fairly sparkles with
dainty melody and somewhat startling harmonies.
It is altogether a charming number
on the organ. 
<h3>HEROLD, Louis Joseph Ferdinand</h3>
The musical talent of this son of an able pianist soon
became apparent, to the delight of his father, who
entered him at the Conservatoire at Paris, the city in
which he was born. Here he soon won the first prize
for piano playing, and in 1812 won the "Grand Prix
de Rome" for a cantata. He composed in many forms,
but the stage furnished greater opportunity for a
man gifted as he was with an ability to express emotion,
and his known works are almost all in dramatic
form. About twenty operas, an enormous number of
piano pieces, a symphony, three string quartettes, and
a number of other works were left by him. Of all this
list, scarcely anything is known in America but the
opera "Zampa."
<h4>346 Overture to Zampa</h4>
This immensely popular overture is about all
that is known in America of this composer's
work. It is delightfully rich in thematic material,
and the workmanship shows the hand of
a master. It is regrettable this composer's
name and fame should rest on this single effort,
for he doubtless wrote much besides this which
is worthy of a hearing. 
<h3>HORSMAN, Edward I., Jr. 1873-</h3>
Was born in New York, March 10, 1873. Musically
he is chiefly self-taught, although he had instruction
from various teachers, principal among which was
his course of counterpoint under S. Austen Pearce.
As an organist, he has held positions at Old St.
Anne's and at St. Luke's, Brooklyn, also St. Andrew's,
New York.
<h4>250 The Curfew</h4>
This is a composition for the organ which was
built upon a theme originally intended for a
song setting to the first verse of Gray's
"Elegy." It is difficult to say whether or not
we have been deprived of any pleasure by the
change of heart on the part of the composer.
The one certain thing is that this American has
given us a charming number, and one which
improves upon acquaintance. 
<h3>HUMPERDINCK, Engelbert 1854-</h3>
Hwmperdinck was born at Siegburg in the Rhine
provinces, September 1, 1854. He displayed a talent
for music early in life, but was the recipient of no
really capable instruction until he was eighteen years
old, at which tilme he entered the Conservatorium at
Cologne, where he studied with Ferdinand Hiller.
While there he wrote a String Quartette which won
for him the Frankfurt Mozart Stipendium, which enabled
him to go to Munich, where he studied with
Lachner and later with Rheinberger at the Royal
Music School. He next won the Mendelssohn Stiftung
of Berlin. He went to Italy and met Wagner at
Naples. Wagner invited him to go to Bayreuth.
Here he became Wagner's valuable assistant in the
production of "Parsifal." Once more, however, his
talent and industry won him a prize, this time the
Meyerbeer prize of Berlin, and once more he started
south. He traveled through Italy, France and Spain,
remaining two years in the latter country, teaching
theory in the Conservatoire at Barcelona. Returning
to Cologne he was professor at the Hoch Conservatorium
from 1890 till 1896.
<p>
All this time he had been busy with his pen, and had
written a great deal of very beautiful music. His
best-known work, an opera, "Hansel und Gretel," for
which his sister wrote the libretto, was produced at
Weimar in 1893 with tremendous success. It is now
one of the standard operas, and is deserving of the
high regard it enjoys. Humperdinck was a rare
master of the techniq,ue of composition~ and while
never short of original thematic matter, was particularly
fond of folk tunes, many of which he used. 
<h4>337 Hansel and Gretel-Vorspiel</h4>
This is one of the loveliest of overtures. The
story is of course based on one of Grimm's
Fairy Tales, and nothing could be more beautifuI
than the music or the story which suggested
it. While the form is more or less free, it betrays
unmistakably the wonderful technique of
the composer. It is interesting to note the way
the first theme is used as an accompanimental
figure in the latter part of the overture. In
fact the development of the thematic material
is nothing short of marvelous. All that can
result from fine material and exquisite workmanship
is found here, and such proximity to
absolute perfection has seldom been attained.
<h4>339 "Evening Prayer and Dance of Angels"</h4>
In this number the composer has used as a first
part or prayer, the first theme of the Vorspiel.
and surely nothing of a more devotional nature
could have been chosen for the purpose. This
theme reappears here in all its loveliness, and
loses nothing of its charm by being linked to the
Angels' Dance. 
<h3>JACOBS-BOND, Carrie</h3>
<h4>289 A Perfect Day</h4>
A very popular and melodious song by a wellknown
song writer of the present day. The
composer's gift of melody is well displayed in
this song. 
<h3>JOYCE, Archibald</h3>
<h4>352 Vision of Salome Waltz from the Ziegfeld Follies of 1910</h4>
This is a very catchy waltz which became popular
immediately upon its presentation in the
Follies of 1910, and has retained its popularity
to an extent seldom enjoyed by music of this
kind. It still possesses all its charm, and will
be found a very satisfactory roll either for dance
purposes or as a musical number. 
<h3>JENSEN, Adolf 1837-1879</h3>
Jensen is known best as a song writer of the German
school. His songs, while original, might have been
written by anyone of several composers contemporaneous
with him. He has written numerous short
piano pieces, and several suites of pieces for piano
and for voices. An unfinished opera was found after
his death.
<h4>137 Murmuring Zephyrs</h4>
A transcription of one of Jensen's most beautiful
songs, and a good example of his ability in
this form of writing. The melody is beautifully
brought out in this roll, and it will be found a
charming number for the organ.
<h4>199 Wedding Music, Op. 45. Bridal Song No.2</h4>
All of the numbers of the set betray the lyric
quality which is so characteristic of the composer's
songs. The "Bridal Song" is perhaps
the best known of the set, and is very effective
on the organ as arranged in this roll. 
<h4>200 Wedding Music, Op. 45. Round Dance No.3</h4>
The round dance is the light number of this set,
and shows Jensen in a frivolous mood not uncommon
to him. It is effective on the organ, as
are the other three of the set.
<h4>201 Wedding Music, Op. 45. March No.1</h4>
This is one of four numbers originally written
for pianoforte duet under the general title of
"Hochzeitsmusik." This is a noble composition
of a stately and dignified character. It
will never supplant Mendelssohn's Wedding
March, which fact, by the way, is nothing to
its discredit, as many other wedding marches
have been written, some perhaps as good musically
as Mendelssohn's, but none seems to have
struck the popular fancy to the same degree.
This march suffers little by comparison, except
when considered as a wedding march. 
<h4>202 Wedding Music, Op. 45 
Nocturne No 4</h4>

This nocturne is quite different in character
from most compositions bearing the same title.
It will be found highly interesting if played in
the proper tempo. It is more often played too
slow than too fast. A safe rule might be to
play it as fast as possible and yet preserve its
inherent dignity. A few playing trials will
reveal the proper tempo, and the result will be
altogether charming. 
<h3>KELER-BELA, Albert von 1820-1882</h3>
The real name of this composer was Albert von Keler.
He was unsuccessful as a farmer and as a lawyer.
Music then seemed to him to be the thing he was best
fitted for, and he began his musical education in
earnest at the age of twenty-five. He spent about nine
years in Vienna, stuilying with Schlessinger and
Sechter, and playing at the theatre. In 1854 he took
the leadership of Gung'l's band in Berlin, and from
this time may be dated his career as a violinist, composer
and conductor. His works reach the startling
opus number of one hundred and thirty, consisting
principally of overtures, dance music and pieces for
solo violin, all of which are distinguished by their
showy and brilliant style, and clever orchestration.
<h4>350 Hungarian Lustspiel Overture</h4>
This is one of the numerous overtures by this
prolific writer and perhaps the one best known
to Americans. Keler-Bela wrote a Lustspiel
Overture and a Hungarian Lustspiel Overture,
which means that he wrote a jolly, playful overture
and a jolly, playful Hungarian overture.
The present one is so full of Gypsy atmosphere
that it need not have been labeled. It will be
found an altogether charming roll. 
<h3>KEY, Francis Scott 1779-1848</h3>
Francis Scott Key, the author of the Star-Spangled
Banner, was the son of John Ross Key, who was an
officer in the Revolutionary Army. He was a lawyer
and a brilliant one, but it is as a patriot that his name
has come down to us. What greater honor could come
to a man than to write a song, the first strains of which
cause a nation to stand in reverence of the flag which
it loves!
<h4>362 Star-Spangled Banner</h4>
The story of this song which means so much to
Americans is a well-known one, but it cannot
be too well known, and for this reason we give
it in detail.
<p>
After the British had burned Washington in
1814, they advanced toward Baltimore, meeting
a small force of Americans, most of whom
they captured and took to the large fleet which
was preparing an attack on Fort McHenry.
A Doctor Beans, an intimate friend of Key,
was among the prisoners taken. To try to intercede
for his friend's release, Key set out in
a sailboat with a flag of truce, for Admiral
Cockburn's ship. He pleaded successfully for
his friend but they were prevented from returning
to Baltimore until morning, by the bombardment
of Fort McHenry, which stood in the
way of the capture of Baltimore.
<p>
For such a patriot as was Key there was no such
thing as sleep. Instead, he watched
<p>
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still
there.
<p>
The first verse was written during his detention,
and the other two ashore. A tune was found
ready-made to fit the words, and one with all
the characteristics of a national air. "To Anacreon
in Heaven" was written by John Stafford
Smith, an English composer, and this tune was
suggested by Judge Nicholson, Mr. Key's
brother-in-law, as a fitting vehicle for the patriotic
verses.
<p>
The present arrangement must be accepted as
official, it having been made by a committee appointed
by the United States Commissioner of
Education. The committee consisted of Will
Earhart (chairman), Walter Damrosch, Arnold
J. Gantvoort, O. G. Sonneck and John
Philip Sousa. The harmonization of the melody
as in the roll is by Walter Damrosch. 
<h3>KINDER, Ralph</h3>
Ralph Kinder is the very well-known organist of Holy
Trinity Church, Philadelphia. He is a brilliant player
and has for years filled this large church with auditors
at his Saturday afternoon recitals. His programmes
are unusually interesting in that ke displays great skill
in their arrangement and remarkable taste in the selection
of compositions. Programme making is an art in
which Mr. Kinder excels, and his technique is such that
the whole range of organ literature is available.
<h4>333 In Moonlight</h4>
This very interesting number begins with a solo
on the chimes. The middle part has a rhythm
which might suggest a barcarole or boat song.
After this interesting movement the first theme
returns and serves as a close.
<h3>KREISLER, Fritz 1875-</h3>
Fate played the trump card in tke destiny of this
artist, as in tke case with many others. His earliest
ambition was to be a tram conductor. Had he been
born in America instead of Austria, he probably would
have aspired to become a policeman. Certainly a
classic from his bow is more pleasant to the ear than
any "step lively please" he could ever have acquired.
At ten he won the first prize at the Vienna Conservatory.
and at twelve performed the unprecedented feat
of capturing the Prix de Rome at the Paris Conservatoire.
He toured America as a boy prodigy with
Rosenthal, returning to Austria to serve his four years
in the army. His next public appearance was in 1899,
from which time his growth in all the essentials which
make for greatness in art has been constant, until
at this time he is very generally thought to be the
greatest violinist alive.
<h4>351 Caprice Viennois</h4>
Kreisler has been wonderfully successful in the
arrangement of folk songs, etc., for the violin,
and his playing of them has popularized them
to the point that a violin recital programme
without a Kreisler number or two is almost a
curiosity. Just how much of the present roll is
original and how much traditional is not a matter
for discussion here. It is possible that in his
work of transcribing, at which he is wonderfully 
adept, the composer has become so saturated
with traditional styles that their influence has
shown itself in his compositions. And it is no
discredit to him if such is the case. We are
concerned, however, only with the musical aspect
of it, and for supreme beauty of its kind
it is unexcelled. The dissimilitude of the
themes forms a contrast which is both startling
and pleasing.
<p>
In the introduction he indulges somewhat in
violin gymnastics, but soon settles down to the
lovely folk-like song which haunts one after a
hearing or two. Then a lively theme which is
distinctly violin music, works itself into a fury,
and finally gives way to a repetition of the folk
theme which makes a fitting ending and leaves
one with a delightful impression of the entire
number.
<h3>LEFEBURE-WELY, Louis James Alfred 1817-1869</h3>
It is rather a rare occurrence for a child to learn his
notes before he does the alphabet. Such was the case,
however, with the subject of this paragraph. At
eight years he played portions of the service for his
father, who was organist at St. Roch. He succeeded
his father upon the death of the latter, though only
fifteen years of age. He wrote much for the piano,
but it is as an organist and writer for the organ that
he will be remembered.
<h4>264 Hymn of the Nuns</h4>
Here we have a pretty theme of a religious
character, embellished in a charming way with
a figure of beauty which constantly recurs above
the main theme. It is a great favorite among
organists and is pleasing when played from the
roll.
<h4>361 Monastery Bells</h4>
This is a charming bit of writing of a kind that
has to some extent gone out of fashion. It is
good music, in fact, it must be, otherwise it
would not have lived so long. The present roll
uses both harp and chimes in a most delightful
manner, and much pleasure is in store for those
who are to hear it.
<h3>LEMARE, Edwin H. 1865-</h3>
This best-known English organist was born in the
Isle of Wight. From the time he entered the Royal
Academy he has shown unusual talent. He excels as
an executant of orchestral works on the organ, but
his playing of legitimate organ works is no less
attractive. He has composed many short pieces for
the organ through which he has become widely known.
<h4>254 Andantino Db</h4>
This is a very popular example of this composer's
work on short pieces for the organ. He
has done many in this style, most of which are
deservedly popular, but this is perhaps the best
known. 
<h3>LEMMENS, Nicholas Jaques 1828-1881</h3>
A Belgian organist of fame. He was a pupil at the
Brussels Conservatory and later became professor
of organ playing at that institution. He left many
compositions, chief of which is Ecole d'orgue, which
has been adopted by the conservatories in Paris,
Brussels, Madrid, etc.
<h4>283 Fanfare</h4>
This is a fascinating bit of writing which is
charming in its simplicity. It would seem that
the composer had started out to have a good
time and had succeeded. 
<h3>LEONCAVALLO, Ruggiero 1858-</h3>
Leoncavallo's first and greatest achievement was the
opera "Pagliacci." He spent a number of years in an
effort to get some of his early operas staged, but was
not successful. "Pagliacci" was an immediate success
and it is on this opera and "La Boheme" that his fame
chiefly rests.
<h4>223 I Pagliacci-Prologue</h4>
Perhaps no single number is better known to
opera goers than this wonderful prologue. As
its title indicates, it occurs at the very beginning
of the opera, and takes the place of the overture.
It is both dramatic and lyric, and presages the
ability of the composer to do justice in a musical
setting to the story which follows. It is sung
by Tonio, the clown, who, after he has finished
forecasting the story of the opera, claps his
hands, singing, "Come then, ring up the curtain."
<h4>231 I Pagliacci -Serenade</h4>
Nothing could be more graceful or dainty than
this lovely serenade, which is sung by Beppe.
He first tunes his mandolin, then sings:<br>
"O Columbine, unbar to me<br>
Thy lattice high,<br>
I watch and sigh,<br>
Longing to hear thee,<br>
And be near thee, as the hours go by." 
<h3>LILIUOKALANI, Queen (Lydia Kamekeha)</h3>
This accomplished woman was the last Queen of the
Hawaiian Islands, and was deposed in 1893. She was
much beloved by her people for her charitable and
kindly instincts. She was a patron of art and did
much for the, progress of her little country. She died
in 1917.
<h4>169 Aloha Oe (Farewell to Thee)</h4>
The words and music of this song are by
Hawaii's former queen. There is an appealing
tinge of sadness in the music which is plainly
evident in the words.
<p>
Proudly swept the rain cloud by the cliff<br> 

As on it glided through the trees,<br>
Still followed with grief the liko,<br>
The ahibilehua of the vale.
<p> 

Thus sweet memories come back to me<br>
Bringing fresh remembrance of the past<br>
Dearest one, yes, thou art mine own,<br>
From thee true love shall ne'er depart.
<p> 

I have seen and watched thy loveliness, 

Thou sweet rose of Maunawili, 

And 'tis there the birds oft love to dwell 

And sip the honey from thy lips.
<h3>LISZT, Franz 1811-1886</h3>
After Liszt had made for himself a reputation which
nothing could shake, his principal aim in life seemed
to be to help to lead others into the light of public
favor. He delighted in cramming down the throats
of the unappreciative public the works of unknown
and struggling composers in whom he discovered the
spark of genius. It is generally accepted that he
was the greatest pianist of all time. As a composer
he ranks very high, and was the originator of the orchestral
form known as the "Symphonic Poem." As
an arranger of well-known airs into concert pieces for
the piano, he was without an equal. A piano recital
without a Liszt composition is a rarity.
<h4>151 Les Preludes</h4>
This is one of a series of twelve orchestral
compositions to which Liszt applied the title
Symphonic Poem. They are all more or less
symphonic in treatment, but are nevertheless
free of many of the conventions of the real
symphony. The title has been used by many
composers since Liszt, when an attempt is made
to produce a musical equivalent to a poetical
idea.
<p>
The resemblance of this form to the symphony
lies in the fact that the themes are developed,
and the lack of resemblance to the symphony, in 
the fact that they are not developed according
to the accepted rule.
<p>
Liszt's inspiration for this particular one is
found in Lamartine's "Meditations Poetiques":
<p>
"What is life but a series of preludes to that unknown
song, the first solemn note of which is sounded by
death? Love forms the enchanted daybreak of every
life; but what is the destiny where the first delights of
happiness are not interrupted by some storm, whose
fatal breath dissipates its fair illusion, whose fell
lightning consumes its altar? And what wounded
spirit, when one of its tempests is over, does not seek
to rest its memories in the sweet calm of country life?
Yet man does not resign himself long to enjoy the
beneficent tepidity which first charmed him on
Nature's bosom, and when 'the trumpet's loud clangor
has called him to arms' he rushes to the post of danger,
whatever may be the war that calls him to the ranks,
to find in battle the full consciousness of himself and
the complete possession of his strength."
<p>
A careful reading of the above paragraph will
add to the enjoyment and understanding of this
composition.
<h4>194 Rhapsodie Hongroise, No.2</h4>
This is one of a number of compositions which
bear the same title, and which have been popular
for many years. They afford the pianist an
excellent opportunity to display his technique
and are not without musical merit. The form 
is one of Liszt's own, beginning with a slow
introduction (Lassan) usually in a minor key,
of a sad character. The middle part (Frischka)
is of a lively nature, while the finale
(Czardas) is wild and riotous. The present
rhapsody is in this form, and is the most popular
one of the set.
<h4>269 Consolation, in Db</h4>
This a lyric of much charm. The melody as
well as certain of the inner parts is brought out
on the organ in a way not easily accomplished .
on the piano.
<h4>319 Liebestraum</h4>
This composition was originally a song, and is
one of three which were written under the title
given above. As we have it on the roll it is a
transcription by the composer of the third song
of the set. It is so much better known than the
other two, that it is invariably referred to as
"Liszt's Liebestraum," the number rarely being
given. It has a beautiful sustained melody
which is never forgotten when once it has made
its imprint on one's memory. The organ does it
full justice, and leaves nothing to be desired in
the effect produced. 
<h4>323 Thou Art Like a Flower</h4>
This is a setting of the famous poem by Heine,
"Du bist wie eine Blume." This lovely poem
has received attention by nearly all the great
composers, and very many of those who could
hardly be called great. It would be safe to
say that no less than a thousand good settings
exist. Of all these, those by Liszt, Schumann
and Rubinstein are best known, and the one by
Liszt does not suffer by comparison with any
of the others. 
<h3>LOHR</h3>
<h4>253 Little Grey Home in the West</h4>
This is a deservedly popular little ballad and
comes at a time when it seems that the art of
writing a ballad which will sing itself has all
but been lost. 
<h3>MacDOWELL, Edward Alexander 1861-1908</h3>
This sterling composer was born in New York City,
and America is proud to own him. His piano playing
was notable, and he has left numerous compositions
which evidence a thorough knowledge of piano technique.
He played a concerto of his own for Liszt, and
so taken with his playing was the great master that he
invited MacDowell to play at the approaching meeting
of the Deutscher Musikverein at Zurich. He
accepted, and made a good impression with his first
pianoforte suite. While perfectly at home in the
larger forms, it is through his numerous short pieces
for the piano, and his songs, that he has endeared
himself to the great musical public. He is thought
by many to be the best composer that America has
ever produced, and they are not far wrong.
<h4>135 Clair de Lune (Moonlight)</h4>
This American composer has written many
lovely compositions, of a type of which this one
is a good example. The tender, plaintive tune
with which it begins is very effective on the oboe,
indeed the use of the oboe all through for the
solo part can hardly be improved upon because
of its plaintive tone quality.
<p>
A brighter middle part in a major key serves to
make a most delightful and striking contrast to
the sombre first theme, which finally is again
heard serving quite as appropriately as a closing
theme. 
<h4>236 Woodland Sketches
 To a Wild Rose" 
"Will o' the Wisp"
</h4>
Two numbers of MacDowell's dainty suite for
piano on one roll. "To a Wild Rose" is as
pretty a bit of plaintive melody as could have
been written by anyone, nor is the melody its
only charm, for the appropriateness of the harmony
is just as striking as the melody is beautiful.
It is altogether lovely, and wonderfully
effective on the organ.
<p>
"Will o' the Wisp" is a riot of notes chasing
each other hither and yon and is in wonderful
contrast to the first number.
<h4>338 A. D. MDCXX</h4>
This composition is one of those mysterious bits
of writing of which MacDowell was so fond,
and which he did in a manner unequaled. The
rhythm strongly suggests the motion of the sea,
as was his evident intention. Much charm is
wrapped up in this little roll, and it will be
found no less satisfactory on the organ than the
piano, for which it was written. 
<h3>MacFARLANE, Will C. 1870-</h3>
William Charles MacFarlane is one of the most famous
of the living organists. He was born in London on
October 13, 1870, and was brought to New York when
four years old. Since he came to this country at so
early an age, and received all his musical education
here, we may justily claim him as an American organist.
He was Samuel P.Warren's pupil for a number
of years and made his debut in 1886. He has played
recitals in all the principal cities and his career both
as organist and composer has been a brilliant one.
<h4>532 Evening Bells and Cradle Song</h4>
Here is a very fine example of the proper use of
chimes. A very familiar bell phrase is first
heard, then the bells find use as an obligato to a
very cleverly written bit of real organ music,
which is followed by a charming middle part
which is the Cradle Song. The first theme
returns and wends its way to a fitting close. 
<h3>MARSHALL</h3>
<h4>255 I Hear You Calling Me</h4>
A very pretty song which had the good fortune
to be introduced to the public by a great singer
whose art has made it one of the things which
every music library must contain. 
<h3>MARTINI, Giovanni Battista 1706-1784</h3>
This composer was born in Bologna, April 24, 1706,
and died in 1784. He was known as Padre Martini.
He is accorded a high place among musicians of the
eighteenth century. He was a student of theology
and philosophy and was regarded an expert violinist.
He was famous throughout Europe, as teacher of
music, composed masses. requiems. and other church
compositions. He also wrote a history of music.
<h4>298 Gavotte in F</h4>
This is a quaint and charming composition with
a beautiful melody forming the basis of it. It
is written with delicate grace throughout and
concludes in a melody of great tenderness. 
<h3>MASCAGNI, Pietro 1868-</h3>
"Cavalleria Rusticana" was first produced in Rome
in 1890 and has held the stage as a favorite among
opera goers ever since. It is Mascagni's only claim to
distinction. He has tried repeatedly to equal it, but
that final critic-the public-has so far withheld its
official stamp of approval. His "Iris," on a Japanese
subject, is his next best work and shows musicianly
skill. Well-informed audiences claim, however, to
discover an altogether too glaring plagiarism of
Wagner to accept it.
<h4>105 Intermezzo from Cavalleria 
Rusticana</h4>
At the first American performance of this opera
the reception given the Intermezzo made it
necessary to play it five times, the audience
refusing to allow the opera to proceed until it
had its fill of this captivating melody. The
millions who have heard it since that time have
added their approval. The opening is a dainty
piece of part writing, giving way presently to
the beautiful melody with harp accompaniment. 
<h3>MASSENET, Jules Frederic Emile 1842-</h3>
This eminent French composer was educated at the
Paris Conservatoire. He won various prizes while
there, both for playing, and for composition. In his
first opera, which has been overshadowed by later
efforts, he showed himself a musician worthy of
attention.
<p>

While his fame rests chiefly upon his operas, of which 

perhaps "Manon" is the most popular, he has shown
himself to good advantage in many other forms, having
written numerous orchestral suites which are
popular with attendants at orchestral concerts, and
a few oratorios which are extremely meritorious.
<h4>107 Meditation-Thais</h4>
This is an enormously popular number from an
opera that, as a whole, is not so well known as
some others by the same composer. It is a delightfully
fervent melody and is played by the
orchestra while the monk Athanael is beseeching
Thais to give up her life of sin.
<h4>143 Angelus</h4>
While Massenet's principal claim to distinction
lies with his operas, he has nevertheless written
many short compositions which endear him to
the musical public, and have given him a host of 
admirers to whom he never would have been
known through his operas alone. His "Angelus"
is a dainty, imaginative bit which has
only to be heard in the organ arrangement to
be liked.
<h4>168 Elegie Op. 10</h4>
A very fine example of graceful melody from a
suite by this famous composer. It is plaintive
in the extreme and is of the type which grows
more beautiful the oftener it is heard. The
organ arrangement contrasts the imitating
voices with exceptional effect.
<h4>309 Last Sleep of the Virgin</h4>
This is a religious prelude, which begins with
chords followed by an effective theme which
rises impressively in this composer's masterful
way. There is, of course, a contrasting section
which is most pleasing and the magnificent
tonal effects of the first part of the composition
are again resorted to.
<h4>357 Vision Fugitive</h4>
This is a bass song from a sacred opera which
had its premier performance December 19, 
1881, at Brussels, where it met with success for
a season, and failed in Paris, where it was presented
in 1884. Many years after it met with
much favor in Paris, and a somewhat garbled
version was given with success at Covent Garden
as "Salome." It is a charming song and a
fine bit of writing by one of the chief exponents
of the French school. 
<h3>MENDELSSOHN-BARTHOLDI, Jakob Ludwig Felix 1809-1847</h3>
Rarely in the world's history has so short a life
been filled with so many great deeds, and rarely has
recognition come to anyone during life as it did to
Mendelssohn. His parents had the means to educate
him liberally, and his refined temperament was inherited.
It would seem, indeed, that here were the ideal
conditions-assuming the possession of unusual talent
-to make a great composer. History does not agree
with this conclusion, however. It seems to be a principle
in nature's great plan that certain obstacles
must be surmounted before greatness can be attained.
Thus it would seem that his greatness lies in the fact
that he became great without opposition. At nine
years he made his first public appearance as a pianist.
At thirteen his Opus 1, which is a string quartette,
was written. Opuses 2 and 3 are in the same form.
He has written in every conceivable form from a symphony
to a song or charming little piece for piano,
and his compositions from a standpoint of refinement
are unequaled. He could be dignified or humorous at
will, but to be vulgar or cheap was not for him.
<h4>120 Wedding March, from Midsummer Night's Dream</h4>
This is unquestionably the most popular number
of the Midsummer Night's Dream music.
It shares with the Bridal Chorus from "Lohengrin"
the well-deserved place which both occupy
in wedding ceremonies. Much wedding music
has been written, but nothing that is likely to
displace either of these in popular favor.
<h4>174 Midsummer Nights Dream Nocturne</h4>
Mendelssohn included all the numbers of the
Midsummer Night's Dream music in Opus 61,
except the overture Opus 21, and places this
lovely Nocturne as Number 7. As an example
of loveliness the theme of this Nocturne has
never been surpassed. It is of the type which
sings itself into one's soul.
<h4>180 Overture to Midsummer Nights Dream</h4>
This wonderful overture, written in 1826, when
Mendelssohn was seventeen, is the most remarkable
example of musical precocity of which there
is any record. It is doubtful if ever there has
been written an overture that excels it in choice
of theme or in masterful workmanship.
The music for the play was not written until
1843, and when performed it was discovered
that each theme of the overture had its proper
place in the play. Thus was given to the world
a forecast of a work to be written seventeen 
years hence. It is interesting to observe that
when the whole work was finished, bringing
about the real purpose for which the overture
was written, the overture was performed in
exactly the form in which it was originally
written, not a note having been changed.
<h4>197 Spring Song (Song Without Words)</h4>
This is perhaps the most admired of all the
Songs Without Words, and as a dainty bit of
writing it is surely unexcelled. It is in a style
which was Mendelssohn's own, and is inimitable.
<h4>286 "On Wings of Song"</h4>
As the title would indicate, this was written as
a song. Its beauty, however, has not escaped
the instrumentalists, and a number of arrangements
have been made for various instruments.
In this respect, the organ now comes into its
own, and the result suffers not at all by companson.
<h4>302 Rondo Capriccioso</h4>
It is extremely doubtful if any other composer
was as consistently characteristic as Mendelssohn.
Very often Brahms might be taken for
Beethoven; Franz, or even Jensen, for Schumann;
Mozart for Haydn, and so on through
the whole list of composers, with a very few
exceptions, of which Mendelssohn is the most
notable. Mendelssohn never wrote anything
which could have been written by anyone else,
or which could be mistaken for the work of any
other composer by one familiar with his work.
The famous Rondo which is the subject of this
paragraph was written when Mendelssohn was
about eighteen years old, and is as genuinely
characteristic of him as anything produced in
maturity. In fact, there seems to have been no
formative period with him-he began at maturity.
<p>
The Introduction is essentially one of the loveliest
of his Songs Without Words, which at the
climax gracefully metamorphoses into a rollicking
rondo, for which there is no duplicate in
musical literature.
<h4>317 War March of the Priests 
Athalie Op. 74</h4>
Mendelssohn composed the incidental music to
"Athalie," a drama by Racine, at the request of
the King of Prussia, who had appointed Mendelssohn
his kapellmeister. The whole set includes
besides this march six vocal numbers and
an overture.
<p>
Little of this music is ever heard except the
march, which is justly popular. It is often
heard as an organ number, the organ being
especially adapted to bring out the ponderous
chords of the first and last parts as well as the
delicate middle part.
<h4>321 Song Without Words. No. 34-Spinning Song</h4>
This is one of the famous Songs Without Words
by this composer, and one of the most interesting
of the set. It is given in all its beauty by
the roll and in a way that it could not possibly
be played on the piano. We suspect that a
delightful surprise is in store for those who know
it only as a piano number, when it is heard from
the organ roll.
<h4>329 Consolation</h4>
This is one of the deservedly popular Songs
Without Words. The title, while not supplied
by the composer, is highly appropriate. It is
perhaps unknown just who is responsible for
the names, but they are generally attributed to
Steven Heller. 
<h4>347 "O for the Wings of a Dove" from "Hear My Prayer"</h4>
This motet is one of three sacred choruses which
form a part of Op. 96. It was originally written
for soprano solo, chorus and organ, but was
later orchestrated. There are two distinct parts
of this composition and the present roll gives
the last half. Never was a melody written so
full of longing, craving, yearning, as this one.
It shows Mendelssohn in a new light to those
familiar only with his instrumental music, and
these will discover that he is no less capable as
a composer of sacred music.
<h4>348 Scherzo (Midsummer Night's Dream)</h4>
This is one of the numbers of the incidental
music to Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's
Dream. All this music was written about
seventeen years later than the overture. It
possesses all the well-known Mendelssohn characteristics
of grace and daintiness, and is such
a Scherzo as no one else could have written.
The organ roll does it full justice, and renders
the number in a way second only to a Symphony
Orchestra. 
<h3>MEYERBEER, Giacomo (Properly Jakob Liebmann Beer) 1791-1864</h3>
Meyerbeer was the son of a wealthy Berlin broker,
Herz Beer. His mother (nee Amalie Wulf) was a
woman of fine mind and high cultivation. A legacy
from a rich relation named Meyer caused him to
change his name to the form with which we are familiar.
His genius came to the surface early in life and
the celebrated Abbe Vogler of Darmstadt invited him
to his home that he might guide him in his studies. At
Darmstadt he learned the science of music and became
famous as an organist with his fugal improvisations.
He is known generally as a writer of French opera,
and it is on his success in this line that his fame rests.
"Robert le Diable" paved the way for his "Huguenots"
and "Le Prophete." These three, with "Africaine,"
are his best-known works.
<h4>141 Coronation March from "The Prophet"</h4>
This is one of the greatest of the many great
marches which have been written by the masters
of composition. It has the martial spirit to an
extent which is not always attained. A remarkable
contrasting of themes as well as the strong.
and unfailing rhythm is responsible for the
interest it arouses. The middle theme is one of
those lovely creations, which once heard is never
forgotten. 
<h3>MOSZKOWSKI, Moritz 1851-</h3>
Moszkowski is known as a pianist, composer and conductor.
He studied at Dresden and Berlin, and became
a teacher at Kullak Academy in the latter city.
He later went to Paris. His compositions are mainly
for the piano, but he has written an opera and some
pieces for orchestra.
<h4>163 Serenade, Op. 15, No.1</h4>
This charming piano piece has been so successfully
transcribed for the violin, as well as for
the organ, that comparatively few people know
its original form. It is one of those lovely little
bits, like Rubinstein's "Melody in F," which
seem to fit all occasions and instruments.
Starting with a quiet theme, it works up into
a very effective climax, after which it returns
to the first theme and finishes. 
<h3>MOZART, Wolfgang Amadeus 1756-1791</h3>
Of the musical prodigies whose development was a
steady growth towards maturity, Mozart was the most
remarkable. He showed his unusual talent as early
as his third year, and from that time on the development
of his genius was uninterrupted. His precocity
excelled even that of Mendelssohn, and at maturity he
was one of the world's greatest composers. A sister,
Maria Anna, displayed almost as much talent as Wolfgang,
and the father took both on a tour, giving concerts
in various cities, exciting wonder and admiration
everywhere. Realizing the wonderful talent of his
boy, Mozart's father, himself a fine musician and composer,
gave himself up entirely to the boy's education
and to him belongs largely the credit for Mozart's
greatness.
<h4>205 Jupiter Symphony. First Movement</h4>
Of the forty-one symphonies written by Mozart,
this one is, next to the one in G minor, the
most often played. It sparkles with the genius
of the composer, who, at the time it was written
(1788), had reached the fullness of maturity.
It is written in the symphonic form of the day,
but shows somewhat greater freedom in the
development of thematic material than his previous
symphonies. It has always been a favorite
number on orchestral programmes and it is
not likely to lose its popularity.  
 
<h4>206 Jupiter Symphony. "Andante Cantabile." Second Movement</h4>
Like most of Mozart's slow movements, the
theme of this one is simple in construction, but
very soon becomes enveloped in a mass of embroidery,
without, however, losing its identity
to any great extent. Mozart's development of
themes consisted largely in making them more
and more ornate, a custom which had been
handed down to him. It remained for Beethoven
to break away from conventionalities
and select development material from the
themes themselves.
<p>
Much care has been expended in making this
number the effective organ number it is, and
the result justifies the effort.
<h4>207 Jupiter Symphony. Minuetto. Third Movement</h4>
This is one of many minuets of the period which
either Mozart or Haydn might have written.
Nor is it a reflection on Mozart to say that
Haydn might have written it. It is epochal.
Dignity and grace are its characteristics, and
its charm lies as much in these qualities as in
its musical beauty.
<h4>208 Jupiter Symphony. Allegro Molto. Final Movement</h4>
The Jupiter Symphony, while perhaps not
so attractive from a purely musical standpoint
as the one in G minor, will always hold the interest
of the studious listener. We know of no
better example of the technique of composition
than this last movement affords. So wonderful
is it structurally that it would seem that Mozart
set about to see what he could do. A marvelous
example of quintuple counterpoint, the equal of
which is scarcely to be found elsewhere, so fluent
as to make one lose sight of the enormous difficulty
involved.
<p>
All of the five themes are easily discernible in
the organ arrangement, which will prove a delight
to the attentive listener. 
<h3>NEVIN, Ethelbert 1862-1901</h3>
An American composer, born near Pittsburgh. He
studied first in Boston wnder B. J. Lang and Stephen
A. Emery, then went to Berlin, where he had the good
fortune to study wnder Von Bulow. He wrote many
songs and short piano pieces, some of which have become
immensely popular because of their beauty of
theme and fine workmamhip. He has written in none
of the larger forma.
<h4>106 "Rosary"</h4>
This is one of the most popular songs ever
written. The lovely sentiment of the words is
undoubtedly as much the cause of its tremendous
favor as the music or what is more likely
the very appropriate wedding of words and
music furnish the reason. In any case, the
music is charming and always gives pleasure
when played from this roll.
<h4>187 Narcissus</h4>
Nevin is well known as the composer of several
short pieces for the piano, and did by far his best
work in sketches of this kind. Narcissus is one
of a set of Water Scenes and is not only the
most popular but the best of the set. Without
introduction it begins at once with a fascinating
theme which is repeated an octave higher, a 
strongly contrasted middle part rises to an
effective climax, after which the first theme is
heard again with a charming imitative part
above. It is a delightful bit of music and extremely
effective on the organ.
<h4>245 Gondolieri-Op. 25, No.2</h4>
This is a rollicking melody of a style seldom
better written than by this composer. It is
from a suite for piano, "A Day in Venice," but
is no less effective as arranged in this case for
the organ. In fact, the many imitative phrases,
of which this composer is so fond, are given their
proper importance by the organ in a way almost
impossible on the piano.
<h4>248 Canzone Amorosa (Love Song)</h4>
This is a lovely melody of a type which is extremely
characteristic of the composer. Unfortunately
it is often badly played, and much of
the charm of the melody is lost because of the
difficulty in bringing out a middle part on the
piano. This cannot be said of the organ, for
the theme is played as a solo, and contrasted
with accompaniment color, so that none of its
beauties is lost. 
<h4>318 Mighty Lak' a Rose</h4>
This is a very appropriate setting to a negro
dialect song by Frank L. Stanton, expressing
the love and admiration of a negro "mammy"
for her baby. Nevin has fully caught the spirit
of the words and so cleverly translated them
into sound that a hearing will almost make one
think what the words say.
<p>
"Sweetest li'l' feller<br>
Everybody knows;<br>
Dunno what to call him,<br>
But he mighty lak' a rose." 
<h3>NICOLAI, Carl Otto Ehrenfried 1810-1849</h3>
In his youth his home was so wncongenial that he ran
away. His education was neglected in every branch
except the piano. He found a protector in one
Adler, who assisted him in his studies and later sent
him to Berlin, where he progressed rapidly in his
chosen profession. He wrote a number of operas, of
which "The Merry Wives of Windsor" is the most
popular.
<h4>225 Overture, "Merry Wives of Windsor"</h4>
While the opera from which this overture is
taken is rarely heard in this country, it is one
of the most popular operas in Europe. The
overture is, however, familiar to American
audiences as it is frequently a part of orchestral
programmes of the lighter order. It is
lovely in theme and of masterful workmanship. 
<h3>OFFENBACH, Jacques 1819-1880</h3>
Offenbach has been called a musical caricaturist, and
not without good reason, as his enormously developed
sense of the ridiculous in music would seem to warrant
the use of the title applied to artists with like
propensities. He wrote about ninety operettas and operas
almost none of which have a serious vein except the
"Tales of Hoffmann," which betrays his ability along
legitimate lines and shows us what might have been
expected from him, had he given more attention to
serious work. It is principaUy through his "Tales of
Hoffmann" that his name will live. His real name was
Levy, but he took the name he used from the place of
his birth, Offenbach-on-Main. In his youth he went to
Paris to study the violoncello and got most of his early
experience playing the cello in orchestras.
<h4>121 Barcarole from Tales of 
Hoffmann</h4>

This little gem is from almost the only serious
opera in a list of about ninety by this composer.
It is from the third act and is perhaps the most
popular excerpt from this justly popular opera,
which has for some years enjoyed a place in the
repertoire of most opera companies both in
America and Europe. 
<h3>PUCCINI, Giacomo 1858-</h3>
Puccini was one of a family which from the time of
his great-great-grandfather produced an uninterrupted
line of musicians. His name earned for him a
pension from the Queen of Italy which made it possible
for him to enter the Conservatory at Milan. He
is known best as a composer of operas, chief among
which are La Boheme, Tosca, and Madame Butterfly.
<h4>272 La Boheme Selections</h4>
This is an interesting collection of the principal
and best-known numbers from the opera, "La
Boheme." It will enable lovers of this opera
to recall with pleasure many of the scenes of
the opera in a manner quite impossible without
the aid of music.
<h4>353 Selections from "Madame 
Butterfly"</h4>

The best-known tunes in this most popular of
Puccini's opera are well represented in this roll,
and to those who are fond of the opera the roll
will revive many pleasant memories. The judicious
use of the Vox Humana and Harp add
wonderfully to the color of this charming music. 
<h3>RACHMANINOFF, Sergei Vassilievich 1873-</h3>
This most talented of all the younger school of Russion
composers showed his natural ability at a very
early age. At nine years he entered the Conservatory
at St. Petersburg, remaining there three years, when
he was transferred to the Conservatory at Moscow,
where he studied the piano with Tschaikowsky's
friend, Zvierev, also with Siloti. Taniev and
Arensky were his teachers in theory and composition.
He is famous not only as a composer but
also as a conductor.
<h4>260 Prelude in C# Minor 
-Op. 3, No.2</h4>
This very wonderful composition has in it something
beside its true musical worth. It has an
appeal to the unmusical, as well as the cultured
musician who values it because of its beauty of
form and wonderful harmonic progressions.
Few indeed are the compositions of so high a
degree of excellence which are so generally admired.
It is a classic and deserving of its popularity.
<h3>RAFF, Joseph Joachim 1822-1882</h3>
He was too poor to afford a teacher, and he taught
himself both in playing and in composition until he
was past twenty. At about this time he sent some
manuscript to Mendelssohn, who discovered talent and
recommended him to Breitkopf & Hartel, the publishers.
He seems to have started his avalanche of
compositions at this time. His extreme poverty made
it necessary that "pot boilera" should receive most of
his attention, but he found time to write much excellent
music. A list of his compositions includes no leas
than eleven symphonies, and ten atring quartettes,
Octettes, aextettes, trios, piano pieces, songs and all
known forma of writing are included in hia two hundred
and sixteen numbered works.
<h4>118 Cavatina</h4>
Many cavatinas have been written, and it is a
form which has not been neglected by the great
composers. It would be unfair to certain other
composers to say that this number is superior to
any other. Nevertheless, never was anything
written in any form which has taken so great
hold on music lovers generally. It was composed
for the violin, is an essential part of the
curriculum of music schools and is played by
students and artists the world over. It is
a charming little work, and very effective on the
organ.
<h4>294 Festival March</h4>
This is a very fine example of martial music
from the pen of a man who neglected none of
the accepted forms of composition, and who in
this instance has adhered strictly to the march
form of his time. This first theme is strong and
well marked, and while of a considerable length
it is never uninteresting. The middle part or
trio is quiet and well contrasted. The first
theme is used again to conclude the march. It
is a fine example of workmanship and particularly
interesting on the organ. 
<h3>ROSSINI, Gioachino Antonio 1792-1868</h3>
One might think, to read some biographies of Rossini,
that his chief claim to distinction was his laziness. As
he wrote upwards of fifty operas, fourteen cantatas, 

six pretentious sacred works and twelve miscellaneous
vocal numbers, it is a little difficult to understand upon
what grounds he was considered lazy. Then, too,
Rossini wrote twenty of these operas in eight years.
What matters it if he wrote some or all of them in bed?
If a sheet of manuscript fell on the floor, surely it
was his business if he preferred to rewrite it rather
than to get out of bed to get it. Lazy or not, he 

wrote a great deal of very fine music, much of which 

will be highly regarded for years to come unless present
indications fail. 

<h4>110 Overture to William Tell</h4>
This overture is surpassed by nothing in the
opera to which it belongs. As an orchestral
concert number it is without a rival in the popularity
it enjoys. The opening movement is
serene and lovely, entirely on the strings. Suddenly
the storm breaks and there is a veritable
riot of sound. The storm over, there is heard
the plaintive piping of Alpine herders, beautifully
interwoven with a gorgeous flute obligato.
The finale is a stirring, martial strain, jubilant 

and victorious in character. 
<h4>184 Cujus Animam-Stabat Mater</h4>
This tenor aria from Rossini's greatest sacred
work is melodiously characteristic of the composer
he wrote upwards of fifty operas, fourteen cantatas, 

It requires a voice of more than ordinary
range and a singer of exceptional ability to produce
a satisfactory result vocally. As an instrumental
number it offers no such difficulties, and
it 
 it will be found particularly effective on the
organ.
<h4>204 Overture to "Semiramide"</h4>
This overture, while not considered to be Rossini's
best effort, is no less a popular favorite,
and justly so. It is certainly the most attractive
of those composed in what might be called the
strict Italian style. The slow movement after
the introduction is a sample of the delicious harmony
of which Rossini was master. This is
followed by a sprightly tune in common time
which contains phrases repeated again and again
after the Italian fashion of that time. This
repetition does not grow tiresome, however, and
this roll is sure to bring pleasure to all who hear
it played.
<h3>RUBINSTEIN, Anton Gregor 1830-1894</h3>
As a perfect technician Rubinstein was about tke only
rival Liszt ever had, but tke charm of kis playing was
not alone due to his great tecknique. He had the
ability to depict every mood from a consuming passion
to a peaceful calm, and he took his audiences with him
wkatever his mood. As a composer ke stands high but
not with tke greatest. His piano compositions betray
his mastery of piano technique as might be expected.
He wrote well for the voice, and many of his songs will
live. The larger forms were not neglected by him,
thougk to-day his operas and oratorios are rarely
performed. Five symphonies, only one of wkich is at
all popular, and numerous concertos for various
instruments are among his pretentious works. While
we should not care to do without his compositions, it
is as one of tke very greatest pianists that he must be
remembered.
<h4>124 Melody in F</h4>
This charming melody was made popular by the
composer himself when he visited this country
in 1872-73. There are many to whom the name
of Rubinstein would be unknown except for this
always popular melody. Like other favorites,
it has been performed on various solo instruments,
and has even taken the form of a vocal
solo and an anthem. It never fails of its charm
in whatever form it is heard.
<h4>142 Bayadere Dance No. 1</h4>
A ballet dance from a little-known opera,
"Feramorz," the libretto of which was founded
on Thomas Moore's "Lalla Rookh." It is
Oriental in style, melodious in the extreme and
an altogether charming bit of writing.
<h4>222 Feramorz-Torchlight Dance</h4>
The third of a set of four dances contained in
the opera "Feramorz." Little is known by
the general public of the opera except the
dances, which happily are popular, and deservedly
so. The charming counterpoint in
this number is beautifully brought out in the
roll and the organ production will be found
entirely satisfactory to lovers of orchestra
music.
<h4>276 Kamennoi-Ostrow-Op. 10, No. 22</h4>
This is the twenty-second portrait in an album
of twenty-four written by the composer during
his stay at Kamennoi-Ostrow, as court pianist
to the Russian Emperor.
<p> 
The subject of this portrait is Mlle. Anna de 

Friedebourg, a German lady in whom Rubinstein
was much interested.
<p> 

Whether the hearer can see in the lovely lyric
theme the character of the lady, or in the
accompaniment the sheen of the moon through the
trees, matters little. The beauty of the composition
as music alone suffices. Of course there
are chapel bells, priests' chants, church organs,
and numerous other things, which present for
imaginative flights a wide enough field to satisfy
the most exacting. 	
<h3>SAINT-SAENS, Charles Camille 1835-</h3>
A French composer of the first rank. His wonderful
knowledge of the technique of composition has caused
some critics to allege that he lacks creative genius.
In other words the charm of his composition is sometimes
said to be due to fine workmanship rather than
to fine thematic material. Perhaps this is true, and if
so, it is the very reason for his large following among 

real musicians. Good and bad embroidery, for 

instance, are made of the same material. After all, 

within reason, it is workmanship that counts most.

No musical form was neglected by this great composer.
We have from his pen symphonics, operas,
cantatas, chamber music, songs and piano pieces;
even for the despised harmonium, his first love, he
wrote three pieces. 
<h4>128 Benediction Nuptiale</h4>
A dainty bit of wedding music is this, and from
a composer from whom we might well expect
just such an example of loveliness. Nor is it
inappropriately named, for it breathes a prayerful
blessing from beginning to end. Originally
written for the organ, the roll is of course
extremely effective.
<h4>228 "My Heart at Thy Dear Voice"</h4>
This is a lovely aria from the biblical opera,
"Samson and Dalilah." The work is seldom
done in its entirety in this country, but this aria
is frequently heard. The fine cantabile of the
theme with the wonderfully contrasted accompaniment
affords the organ an opportunity
which is not always present.
<h4>251 Le Cygne (The Swan)</h4>
This little piece is familiar to most people as a
cello or violin solo, but it will be found quite as
effective on the organ. The harp-like effect of
the accompaniment as arranged in this roll is
both interesting and beautiful. 
<h3>SALOME, Theodore Cesar 1834-1896</h3>
A French organist born in 1834; died in 1896. He
studied under Ambroise Thomas at the Paris Conservatoire,
where he won the Prix de Rome. He composed
many works for the organ.
<h4>306 Cantilene. Transcription by Guilmant</h4>
This is a sentimental composition with a touch
of sadness. The melody adds to the beauty of
the theme by a strain of tender feeling. Guilmant's
transcription will be found especially
pleasing.  
<h3>SCHARWENKA, Franz Xaver 1850-</h3>
Many of the concert goers of about twenty-five years
ago will recall with pleasure the marvelous playing of
this great pianist. He came to America the same year
as Paderewski, and much controversy was indulged in
as to their respective abilities. Of course nothing is
ever accomplished by such controversy, and each retained
his own following. Certainly for beauty of
tone no man ever surpassed Scharwenka. His technical
equipment is equal to anything, and his playing
invariably stamps him as a very great musician.
His compositions always possess charm, and he has
written in practically every orthodox form. At the
present time Scharwenka lives in Berlin, where he leads
a very busy life as a teacher and composer.
<h4>297 Polish Dance</h4>
Perhaps nothing of equal difficulty is as well
known as this charming bit of dance music. It
was well known when Scharwenka came to
America, and he played it hundreds of times on
his tours. Many times an audience refused to
vacate until he gave his conception of this bit of
his own work.
<p>
The organ is well qualified to bring out its
beauties, and we suspect that many charming
effects will be heard for the first time from the
roll, especially by those who never heard the
composer play it.
<h3>SCHUBERT, Franz Peter 1797-1828</h3>
Of all the younger contemporaries of Beethoven, Schubert
was the most gifted; his talent for music manifesting
itself at an early age, he readily mastered the
violin and piano. He also began to compose and his
ability astounded his teachers, who proclaimed him a
genius. Handel, Bach, Mozart and Haydn wrote
with great rapidity, but nothing like that of Schubert.
His ideas flowed faster than he could write them; in
fact, after reading a poem once or twice he had a
beautiful and appropriate setting for it. His earliest
known composition was a fantasie for piano, which he
composed at the age of thirteen. At fifteen he wrote
some larger instrumental works. His most fruitful
year was 1815, his compositions for that year totaling
one hundred and ninety-five, embracing symphonies,
masses, songs and choral and chamber music. Schumann
said of him, "He has tones for the most delicate
shades of feelings, thoughts, even accidents and occurrences
of life. Manifold though the passions and
acts of men may be, manifold is Schubert's music.
That which his eye sees, his hand touches, becomes
transformed to music."
>h4>186 Serenade</h4>
There is probably no greater favorite among the
Schubert songs than this. It was one of the
very last songs he wrote, and with a few others
was published under the title, "Swan Songs."
A verse will suffice to describe the mood.
<p>
Thro' the night, my songs entreating<br>
Gently plead with thee;<br>
While the silent hours are fleeting,<br>
Dearest, come to me!
<h4>173 Moment Musical, Op. 92, No.2</h4>
As an example of Schubert's ability to make
much of a simple theme, this little number is
remarkable. Anyone else would have made
of this same rhythm a very good tune for hurdygurdy
purposes, but certainly not the sparkling
bit of real music which Schubert has given us.
<h4>203 Allegro Moderato. Unfinished Symphony (B Minor)</h4>
Schubert's first symphony was written in 1814,
his eighteenth year. Between this date and
1818 five more were written. While these six
symphonies are in places slightly reminiscent
of Haydn and Mozart, and to a lesser degree
of Beethoven, one cannot listen to any of them
without a feeling that a new master of orchestral
composition has arrived.
<p>
In the B Minor (1822) we have a composition
so wonderfully original that no part of it is
traceable to any influence other than the great 
genius possessed in the frail body of the
composer.
<p>
For beauty of themes and harmonies, nothing
can surpass this work. A more perfect example
of composition does not exist.
<h4>209 Andante con moto. Unfinished Symphony (B Minor)</h4>
This divine slow movement is an example of
Schubert at his very best. In it he has shown
his wonderful facility of modulation, and given
us a further taste of luscious melody, marvelously
simple and appealing. No one could have
done it but Schubert, and it is doubtful if any
single composition is so perfectly satisfying to
as great a number of people. One need not be
a musician to enjoy it; on the other hand, the
profoundest musical knowledge is necessary to
fathom its full depth of beauty. 
<h3>SCHUMANN, Robert Alexander 1810-1856</h3>
Not until Schumann was twenty years old did he decide
finaUy to become a musician, although we have
his word for it that he began to compose before he
was seven. His father, who had some reputation as
an author, was in sympathy with his son's leaning
toward art, but his mother wanted him to study law.
Only after years of more or less perfunctory study of
law did he finally obtain his mother's reluctant consent
to apply himself solely to music. His first ambition
was to become a great pianist and such he should
have been but for an overanxiety to obtain finger
dexterity in the shortest possible time. He invented a
contrivance to hold back the third finger while he
practised with the other fingers. This resulted in
strained tendons and a crippled finger which remained
useless through life. He now felt that his
time spent in the study of law and in piano practice
was lost, and gave the study of composition hia whole
attention. Tragic as was Schumann's emperience, it
seems that it might have been Fate's way of compelling
him to do what he was destined to do, and the
world would surely have lost much but for his seeming
misfortune. He left us hundreds of compositions,
which represent every possible form, and so wonderful
are all that none can say at which form he was
best. Though his disposition was quiet and dignified,
he was at times jovial, and he has given us all his
moods in his compositions.
<h4>104 Traumerei and Romanza</h4>
Who of the great composers has not written a
Traumerei? Nearly all have done it. How 
many of their names would have become immortal
through the writing of a Traumerei
alone? Just one, and his name is Schumann.
Anything in the way of a description is useless,
for Traumerei has a different message for all
its hearers. The one point upon which all agree
is its superlative beauty.
<p>
The Romanza which forms a part of this roll,
while a separate and distinct number, is so aptly
fitted to Traumerei that the latter is almost
never played without the Romanza. The orthodox
method of using the Romanza as a middle
and contrasting part is followed in this roll.
Traumerei being used again after the Romanza.
<h4>176 Slumber Song</h4>
This is one of Schumann's many short pieces
for the piano. No one wrote better for the
piano than Schumann, and he was especially
happy in short pieces such as this. The charm
in this slumber song, aside from the beauty of
the theme, is due largely to the syncopated
accompaniment. The strong contrast between
the first and second themes also contributes
largely to the interest.
<h4>325 Two Grenadiers</h4>
This is a very great song, not greater than
might be expected from Schumann, but fully
up to the standard. The treatment of the text
is appropriate, and the final episode wherein he
has introduced the Marseillaise is wonderfully
stirring. It is one of the classics that everyone
should know. 
<h3>SEELING, Hans 1828-1862</h3>
This composer was born in 1828 at Prague. He died
in 1862. Seeling won recognition as a pianist, making
his first public appearance in Italy and later making
concert tours through France and Germany.
<h4>281 Lorely</h4>
This piece was written for the piano and must
not be confused with the German folk song of
the same name. It contains a broad melody to
a running accompaniment and is most effective.
<h3>SIBELIUS, Jean 1865-</h3>
Like Tschaikowsky and many others, Sibelius was
made by his parents to study law. His unusual talent
asserted itself, however, and he began to study music
seriously at the conservatorium, and later studied
composition wnder Becker at Berlin and Goldmark at
Vienna. His compositions all show the influence of
the Finnish Folk Song and this characteristic, combined
with his great skill in writing and colorful
scoring, makes him a great favorite among concert
goers. His works include all forms from a song to a
symphony.
<h4>220 Valse Trieste</h4>
This lively and unique valse is from the incidental
music to the drama "Kuolema"-a
drama of death. It is highly characteristic of
Sibelius and we know of no other composer
who could have written it. The first theme is
almost gruesome, but the middle part is in
striking contrast. Altogether it is as charming
a bit of orchestral writing as one could desire,
and the organ is a particularly effective vehicle
for its expression.
<h4>271 Finlandia (Tone Poem)</h4>
This is one of the chief works of this Finnish
composer, and certainly the best known. Much
could be said about it, but it speaks for itself.
Like all of his work, it smacks of folk song.
Although the composer says he does not use
folk song, he is evidently unable to get away
from its influence; indeed, it would be a pity if
he could. Its wonderful weirdness is chiefest
of its charms, and one which it would lack if he
stooped to conventional methods. The whole
number is lovely on the organ, but the wonderful
chorale-like movement is unequaled.
<h3>SMETANA, Friedrich 1824-1884</h3>
This first great Bohemian composer was born at
Leitomischl. He studied at Prague with Proksch and
later with Liszt. He was a famous pianist, and opened
a school at Prague, where he also married the pianiste,
Katharina Kolar. In 1856 he became director of the
Philharmonic Society at Gothenburg, Sweden, where
his wife died in 1860. After a tour of Sweden in 1861
he returned to his native country and became chief
conductor of the National Theatre in Prague. Here
he brought out his famous opera, "The Bartered
Bride." Numerous works in all forms were written
by him, but the two which are best known and have
perhaps the most merit are the opera mentioned above
and a string quartette, "Aus Meinen Leben" (Out of
My Life), which is a very remarkable work. In the
finale of this quartette there is a high note which is
persistently heard and which is supposed to represent
a similar sound which he constantly heard as a result
of his deafness. He died in an insane asylum at
Prague.
<h4>315 "The Bartered Bride"-Overture</h4>
This work was first produced at Prague in 1866.
It met with instant success and has since become
a standard in Europe. The overture is a general
favorite with orchestra conductors and with
the public, being very often heard at orchestral
concerts. This roll is most effective in that all
the counter themes are brought out in a way
that they may be heard and understood. In a
word, the organ gives from the roll as complete
a rendition as does the orchestra. 
<h3>SOUSA, John Philip 1856-</h3>
John Philip Sousa is an American. He was born in
Washington, D. C. His musical talent asserted itself
early in life, and he studied the violin. He was violinist
in the orchestra led by Offenbach during his visit
to America in 1877. He enlisted in the service of the
United States in 1880 and was appointed Director of
the Marine Band. which became famous under his
directorship. He later formed a band organization
of his own and toured the world.
He composed a few comic operas, some of which enjoyed
notable popularity. but it is his fascinating
marches that endear him to the public. The march as
he wrote it is largely an original form, and the form
has been used to the practical exclusion of all others
since.
<h4>278 King Cotton March</h4>
This march is too well known to require description
of any kind. It will suffice to say that it is
one of the very best by this composer. When
this is said it is to be assumed that it is one of
the best by any composer, for certainly no one
has done better work of this kind than our own
John Philip Sousa. 
<h3>STEBBINS, C. A.</h3>
<h4>164 In Summer</h4>
This delightful bit opens with a mysterious
harmonic progression, and is followed by one
of the quaintest themes imaginable. The middle
section works up to a tremendous climax
which suddenly stops to permit a rehearing of
the first theme. The close is effectively brought
about by the use of chords suggesting those used
in the introduction. 
<h3>STRAUSS, Johann 1825-1899</h3>
This son of an innkeeper first distinguished himself
by running away from a bookbinder to whom his
father apprenticed him. A friend found him and
brought him back home, prevailing upon his parents
to allow him to take the boy and teach him music.
This was the inauspicious beginning of the greatest
dance-music writer of the world. His works are famous
for their bewitching rhythms and tuneful themes.
He also was famous as a conductor, traveling all over
Europe with an orchestra, receiving the highest honors
everywhere he played.
<h4>192 Blue Danube Waltz</h4>
This tuneful waltz has impressed itself on the
minds of thousands and has made Johann
Strauss known as the WaItz King, and was
imported into America by the late Theodore
Thomas, who knew its composer intimately and
admired the waltz when he heard it in Vienna.
It was first performed in America in New York,
in 1867. Since then, it has been heard throughout
the country and its admirers are legion. 
<h3>STRAUSS, Richard 1864-</h3>
Coming of a musical family, he began to play the
piano at four, and to compose at six. Starting out
with classical ideals, he has become the last word in
modern musical thought. Some consider this a transition
from the sublime to the ridiculous, others not.
It will take many years to decide. Beethoven sounds
very well to most of us, but time was when he was
thought just as radical as we now think Strauss to
be. At any rate, it is better to enjoy what we can
of his writing than to find fault about that we do not
like. His best-known works, aside from his songs, and
the works upon which his reputation stands, are two
tone poems, "Tod und Verklarung" and "Till Eulenspiegels
lustige Streiche" for orchestra, and his opera
"Salome." These compositions are also responsible
for most of the controversy concerning him.
<h4>179 At the Spring-Op. 9, No.2</h4>
This is a charming melody over a rippling
accompaniment, perhaps intended to represent
the incessant purling of the spring. The
melody is one of wonderful simplicity considering
that we are apt to think that the name
"Strauss" and the word "complexity" are synonymous.
The composer's true greatness is
proven by his ability to write a charming little
thing such as this no less than in the writing of
some of his massive and complex scores. 
<h4>213 Wiegenlied</h4>
This number is interesting aside from its musical
beauty, in that it proves that a composer
whom we are accustomed to think of as a writer
of the most complex melodies and harmonies
can write in a charmingly simple style. Here
is a sustained melody which moves smoothly
along, supported by plain broken chords which
are so effective on the organ as to leave nothing
to be desired. 
<h3>SULLIVAN, Sir Arthur Seymour 1842-1900</h3>
From a viewpoint of versatility, Sullivan had no superior.
Greater things have been written than anything
he has left us, but it is doubtful if any nation will ever
produce a man with the ability to write fitting music
for a given situation to the degree that Sullivan had
that ability. His music is beautiful always from a
musical point of view, but when the situation for which
it was written is taken into account, it is superlative.
His mastery of the technique of composition was so
great that it seemed impossible for him to write anything
below the very high standard by which we know
him. The "Mikado" and the "Lost Chord" have
immortalized him, of course, but he has stronger
claims on fame than either or both of these numbers.
His compositions include practically all known forms,
symphonies, concertos, suites for orchestra, oratorios,
songs, etc.
<h4>108 The Lost Chord</h4>
This is perhaps the most popular song ever
written. Sullivan wrote it one night while he
was watching at the deathbed of his brother.
The patient had lapsed into a peaceful slumber,
when Sullivan took up a volume of Adelaide
Procter's poems. He had tried before to set
the words of this song, but unsuccessfully. In
the deathlike stillness of the night, however,
the immortal music came to him, and was
written down. The music has immortalized the poem. 
<h3>SUPPE, Franz von 1820-1895</h3>
Suppe seemed to be possessed of a talent for the ridiculous,
as well as for music. He wrote numerous so called
operas, but one of his critics said that his works
reached the astounding total of two grand operas,
one hundred and sixty-five farces, comediettas and
vaudevilles. His work is tuneful and light but is apt
to be lacking in dignity.
<h4>191 Overture "Poet and Peasant"</h4>
Practically the only composition of Suppe's
ever played in this country is this overture.
Altogether it is an attractive bit of writing, with
its tuneful melodies and well-written harmonies.
It is a general favorite with bands and orchestras,
and has a host of admirers. 
<h3>SVENDSEN, Johann Severin 1840-1911</h3>
This eminent Norwegian composer displayed his
talent at the early age of eleven years in a composition
for the violin, which instrument he played until
his career as an executant was cut short by his hand
becoming paralyzed. He then turned to composition,
and went to Leipsic where he studied under Hauptmann,
David, Richter, and Reinecke.
<p>
Among his best-known compositions are his String
Quartette in A Minor, String Octette in A Minor,
and the Romanze for Violin and Orchestra in G.
<h4>144 Romanze in G, Op. 26</h4>
Like Raff's Cavatina, this number was written
for the violin, and similarly has become an absolute
necessity to violin literature. It is beautifully
melodious and teems with lovely contrasts
and delightfully quaint harmonies, fitting the
organ as though it had been written for it. 
<h3>TATE</h3>
<h4>257 Somewhere a Voice is Calling</h4>
This is one of the popular ballads of the day.
It is tuneful, harmonious, and the sentiment is
pretty. What other charms are needed?
<h3>THOMAS, Charles Louis Ambroise 1811-1896</h3>
A pupil at the Conservatoire, he won the first prize for
piano in 1829; for harmony in 1830, and the grand
prize in 1832. After writing a number of compositions
in various forms, he took to grand opera, wrote
voluminously and with much success. "Mignon" was
perhaps his greatest success, being at least the one
best known to the present generation. Others are
occasionally performed, however, and excerpts from
many of them are among the favorite songs of operatic
singers.
<h4>140 Gavotte from Mignon</h4>
This lovely gavotte from Thomas' best-known
opera has been a favorite with organists for
many years. Its charm lies in its daintiness and
grace of rhythm as well as in the innate beauty
of the melody.
<h4>336 Raymond Overture</h4>
This is the overture to an opera which was first
produced on June 5, 1851. It is known now
only as a concert overture, and is one of the best
of the school to which it belongs. In the present
arrangement the colorful scoring of the
composer is well brought out and the result is
charming. 
<h3>THOME, Francis 1850-1909</h3>
A French composer whose compositions betray both
his origin and the source of his education. They have
the grace characteristic of the French and are charming
bits of melody. Thome was a teacher and critic
as well as a composer and resided in Paris.
>h4>160 Simple Aveu, Op. 25</h4>
The usual translation of the title, "Simple Confession'"
gives a very good idea of the intent of
this composition. It is a sort of song without
words which sings itself into one's memory to
stay.
<h3>TITT'L, J.</h3>
<h4>157 Serenade</h4>
This appealing serenade was originally written
for flute and horn, with orchestral accompaniment.
While not a great composition, it nevertheless
appeals to many people through its tuneful
and restful qualities. As heard on the organ
it is very enjoyable. 
<h3>TOSTI, Francesco Paolo 1846-</h3>
This very prolific song writer was of Italian birth,
as his name would indicate. He studied violin and
composition at the Royal College in Naples, and at
the same school progressed rapidly as a singer. It
was as a singer that he was later to become famous.
After several visits to London, he finally settled there
and became singing instructor to the royal family.
He has written nothing but songs, many of which are
very beautiful and deservedly popular.
<h4>193 Good-bye</h4>
Tosti seems to have caught the spirit of Whyte-
Melville's poem, and has produced a very lovely
song which is known the world over. It has
stood the test of time, and there are as yet no
evidences of waning popularity. 
<h3>TSCHAIKOWSKY, Peter Iljitch 1840-1893</h3>
There are two classes of Russian composers; that
which pays little heed to traditional and accepted
musical forms, but which asserts a passionate nationalism
easily recognized by wild melodies and weird
harmonies, and that which recognizes the beauties and
value of accepted forms, but still retains the Slavic
characteristics. Of the latter class, Tschaikowsky
was the greatest.
<p>
He did not take up the study of music as a vocation
until after he ltad graduated from a school of jurisprudence,
and had received an appointment from the
Ministry of Justice, at the age of nineteen. He became
a pupil of Rubinstein in composition, and of
Zaremba in counterpoint. Among his compositions
will be found music in nearly all forms and for all
combinations of instruments and voices.
<h4>171 Allegro non troppo (First Movement) from Pathetique Symphony (No.6)</h4>
There is nothing in symphonic form which overshadows
this great work in popular favor. It
would be difficult to find a person who does not
respond to some part of it. Tschaikowsky's
brother, Modest, speaks of this symphony as an
"act of exorcism" whereby Peter cast out all the
dark spirits which had possessed him in the preceding
years. It is certainly no less a work of
the heart than of the mind.
<h4>324 Allegro Molto Vivace (3d Movement) from Pathetique Symphony No.6</h4>
The beginning of this movement so strongly
suggests the orthodox Scherzo form that one
would expect nothing else on the first hearing.
When this Symphony was being worked out in
the composer's mind, he wrote his nephew,
Vladimir Davidov, to whom he eventually dedicated
it, "There will be much that is novel as
regards form in this work." He fulfilled his
promise in this movement as well as in the finale.
After only eight measures of the wildest sort
of a theme which alternates between the strings
and wood winds, two measures of what is to
develop into the dominating theme of the whole
movement are heard. These two themes either
in rhythmic or melodic form are almost never
absent from beginning to end. One or two
others assert themselves momentarily, but inevitably
succumb to the rush of the first theme
and the incessant trudge of the second.
In the development of thematic matter, this
whole work is very remarkable. The composer
believed it to be his greatest work, and wrote of
it, "without exaggeration I have put my whole
soul into this work."
<h4>256 Andante from String Quartette-Op.11</h4>
All the great composers displayed a fondness
and reverence for the string quartette form
which resulted in their putting their very best
efforts in this form. This Andante is one of
the loveliest of slow movements. There is but
little polyphonic writing in it, but the most
luscious harmonies compensate for any lack of
contrapuntal work. The second theme is one
of extreme beauty, and is largely responsible
for the popularity this number enjoys among
the laity and profession.
<h4>263 Chant Sans Paroles</h4>
This "Song Without Words" is an example of
the luscious melody of which Tschaikowsky was
capable. The middle part with its imitation in
the octave is splendidly brought out in the roll,
and serves to heighten the contrast between the
two themes.
<h4>358 March from the "Nut Cracker Suite"</h4>
This entire ballet, "Casse-Noisette," which was
written for the Russian Imperial Opera, comprises
fifteen numbers. It was the composer
himself who selected what he considered the best
numbers and grouped them into the suite from
which this March is taken. This Suite is often
played by large orchestras and is a very general
favorite with concert goers.
<p>
This March is noble and rugged and lacks none
of the essentials of a fine March. It is distinctly
Russian in style, and is altogether a charming
composition. The organ gives it from the roll
in a manner not at all disappointing to those
who have heard it from a large orchestra and
who are familiar with its startling color effects.
<h4>359 "Valse des Fleurs" from "Nut Cracker Suite"</h4>
In this number the composer has broken away
from all restraint, and given himself over to a
riot of tone color. The thematic material would
scarcely stand alone as a sample of Tschaikowsky's
work. In fact, it is little above commonplace.
But results count, and a more exquisitely
charming bit of music could not be found.
Here the composer has shown himself to be a
master workman and he has used all the tools
supplied him by the modern orchestra. In fact, 
he was the first to introduce the Celesta as an
orchestral instrument, and it made its first appearance
in this Suite.
<h4>360 "Danse Russe" and "Danse des Mirlitons" from the "Nut Cracker Suite"</h4>
The "Danse Russe," the first of the two numbers
on this roll is one of those impetuous Russian
dances which are familiar to most of us.
The characteristic rhythm of a long note followed
by two short ones is well adapted to the
increasingdury of the dance, which finishes in
the peculiar Russian fashion.
The second number, "Danse des Mirlitons," is
in a much more delicate vein, and appropriately
so, for it is a dance of the toys or automatons.
Here is displayed again the wonderful imagination
of the composer. The exquisite color
effect, and dainty rhythms form a delightful
combination, and the roll is altogether satisfactory.
<h3>TYERS</h3>
<h4>259 Admiration (Tango)</h4>
For those who like to dance the tango, this number
will be found all that can be desired. It is
one of the very popular tangoes.
<h3>UNKNOWN COMPOSERS</h3>
<h4>327 "Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes" (Old English Air.)</h4>
As to who was the composer of this wonderful
song, there is much speculation. History does
not record his name, but this fact does not detract
from our enjoyment of it. Ben Jonson
wrote the poem, and the poetic sentiment of the
words is so well matched by the tune that it
would be a crime to sing the words to any other
tune, or to use the tune for any other words.
<h4>328 Loch Lomond (Old Scotch Song)</h4>
There is perhaps no better known Scotch song
than this one, and certainly none more deserving
of popularity. It is a regrettable fact that the
identity of the composer is unknown, for his
work has become a classic. The roll renders it
in a manner second only to the human voice. 
<h3>VERDI, Giuseppe 1813-1901</h3>
Why not the "Grand Old Man" of music? We have
the "Grand Old Man" of everything else! Surely
none deserves the title better than Verdi. He came
into the world surrounded by poverty, and had to
fight for his very existence. Artistic surroundings
were unknown to him, but his genius was of the sort
which stands the test of fire and triumphs over every
obstacle. His chief delight when a child was, singularly,
to follow a grind organ when one passed
through the village. Little knew he that in after life
many of his tunes would be played on these abominations.
It's a long and sad story, but a wonderful one,
and there is nothing stranger in fiction. Trouble was
his in great measure. Let him tell of the death of his
wife and two children: "In a very little over two
months, three persons so very dear to me had disappeared
forever. I was alone! My family had been
destroyed; and in the midst of these trials I had to
fulfill my engagement and write a comic opera." The
opera was a failure, but failure is a stimulus to genius.
"Otello" and "Falstaff" are Verdi's two last and greatest
operas, and both were written at about eighty years
of age. This feat is absolutely without precedent.
Surely was he the "Grand Old Man" of music.
<h4>123 Marchfrom Aida</h4>
Many operatic composers have realized the
opportunities presented by the march form
for effective writing. Verdi, in this instance,
availed himself of all the arts and crafts of the 
stage, as well as of his own cleverness in the
production of one of the most pompous and
picturesque examples of martial music. This
march is from the second act of Aida, and celebrates
the return of the warrior Radames from
a victorious campaign against the Ethiopians.
<h4>178 Quartette from Rigoletto</h4>
This quartette from Verdi's most popular opera
has commanded the attention and admiration of
audiences from the time of the first production
of the opera in 1851. With Handel's "Messiah"
and Rossini's "Barber of Seville," it
stands as one of the greatest feats of rapid composing.
In exactly forty days from the time
Verdi received the libretto, the score was finished.
The quartette shares with "La Donna
e mobile" the approbation which both deserve.
>h4>354 Selections from Il Trovatore</h4>
At the first performance of this opera at the
Teatro Apollo on January 19, 1853, it was
given the stamp of public approval. The fine
tunes which have been made familiar to us as
much through the agency of the ubiquitous hand 
organ and street piano as by any other agency,
have long since proved that they have in them
the stuff which makes them "stick." Verdi was
was so prodigal with his gift of melody, which
is so simple and catchy, that one is apt to overlook
the gorgeous harmonies he often uses. Of
course the prime essential of an opera-especially
an Italian opera, at the time Il Trovatore
was written-was melody, and as a result of the
prevailing style many beautiful melodies have
come down to us which we should not have had
if the present Italian style had been in vogue
at that time. 
<h3>WAGNER, Wilhelm Richard 1813-1883</h3>
A volume would not suffice to give any idea of the
wonderful musical and literary activity of this man.
He was perhaps the busiest of all composers because
he was not content to simply compose the music to
his operas, but must write the librettos, also. It was
necessary, too, that he should have much to say about
the staging and costumeing, for his work was so absolutely
new and unique that traditional methods would not do.
Wagner owed to Liszt, whose son-in-lae he later
became, much of the recognition he received during
his life. Liszt was one of the first to discover
Wagner's genius and his (Liszt's) standing in the
musical world made it possible, too, for him to insist
that the public should hear and accept Wagner.
Without such assistance Wagner would have had a
harder time of it than he did, and his pugnacious
disposition would probably have shelved him as a popular
idol for many years. With the support of Liszt, he
could not be kept out of the place to which his genius
rightfully entitled him.
<h4>108 Minster March from Lohengrin</h4>
An example of dignified writing such as we
would expect from the pen of Wagner. The
charming opera from which this is taken was
first produced at Weimar in 1850 by Liszt, and
from that time has grown in public favor to the
point of being a standard in the repertoire of
all opera companies.
<h4>118 Vorspiel-Lohengrin</h4>
It is doubtful if any other orchestral number is
so frequently played on the organ. So admirably
does it fit the organ, that one would think
Wagner had the organ in mind when he wrote
it. The history of the Holy Grail was the basis
of the inspiration and it is probable that n9thing
more ethereal has ever been written.
<h4>210 Lohengrin, Introduction to 
Act III</h4>
This is another example of Wagner's charming
wedding music. It is intended to depict the
happiness and gaiety of the festivities attending
the wedding of Elsa and Lohengrin.
<h4>114? Prize Song-Meistersinger</h4>
This best-known excerpt from the Meistersingers
is the song with which Walther wins
Eva as a bride. The song comes to Walther as
a dream, and he sings it on the advice of Hans
Sachs in competition with the Meistersingers,
the prize being Eva, the daughter of Pogner,
the goldsmith.
<h4>117 Funeral March from Die 
Gotterdammerung</h4>

This wonderful piece of orchestral writing is
composed of the principal themes of the opera
which have to do with Siegfried's life. It is
solemn in the extreme and very dignified. In
fact, just such music as one could wish might
accompany the funeral procession of the hero
Siegfried.
<h4>115 Abschied und Feurzauber</h4>
This is said to be one of Wagner's best efforts
at descriptive writing. Whether it depicts the
circle of fire with which Wotan causes Brunhilde
to be protected is not a matter for comment
here. For our purposes. it will suffice to
say that from a musical viewpoint it is highly
satisfactory even with the descriptive idea eliminated.
<h4>195 Overture to Tannhauser</h4>
"Tannhauser" was first produced at Dresden
in 1845, and was anything but an unqualified
success. Critics of the time seemed united in an
effort to condemn it; even some of the singers
pronounced their parts impossible. Tastes have
changed since then and the beginning of the
change dates from about the time that Liszt
began to use his enormous influence in Wagner's
behalf, and but for Liszt it is quite probable
that Wagnerian operas would not now
enjoy the vogue they do. The Overture to
"Tannhauser" is a stupendous effort and it will
live for centuries. As a concert number it is
indispensable, and as an introduction to the
opera it falls nothing short of requirements.
<h4>122 Evening Star Song-Tannhauser</h4>
While this wonderful song is in marked contrast
to much of Wagner's work, it only serves to further
prove the greatness of the man. Nothing
could establish his case more conclusively than
the charming simplicity of this song. It is sung
by Wolfram on the departure of Elizabeth and
is a prayer that she may be borne beyond the
vale of sorrow.
<h4>130 March-Tannhauser</h4>
This is a striking piece of martial music written
to accompany the arrival of the guests at a singing
festival. After a fanfare by the trumpeters,
the noblemen and their followers march in,
bowing as they pass their hosts, Landgrave,
Hermann and Elizabeth. When the hall is
filled, all join in singing with the orchestra, producing
a stirring climax of the sort for which
Wagner is famous.
<h4>320 Vorspiel-Tristan and Isolde</h4>
This is the overture to an opera which contains
by common consent some of the most beautiful
music ever written. The story of this famous
number is furnished by Wagner himself, and
we quote it in full.
<p>
"A primitive old love poem, which, far from having
become extinct, is constantly faahioning itself anew,
and has been adopted by every European language
of the Middle Ages, tells us of Tristan ood Isolde.
Tristan, the faithful vassal, woos for his king her for
whom he dare not avow his own love, Isolde, who
powerless to do otherwise than obey the wooer, follows
him as bride to his lord. Jealous of this infringement
of her rights. the Goddess of Love takes her revenge.
As the result of a happy mistake she allows the couple
to take of the love potion, which in accordance with
the custom of the times and by way of precaution,
the mother had prepared for the husband who should
marry her daughter from political motives, and which,
by the burning desire which suddenly inflames them
after tasting it, opens their eyes to the truth, and
leads to the avowal that for the future they belong
only to each other; Henceforth there is no end to
the longing, the demands, the joys and the woes of
love. The world, power, fame, splendor, honor, knighthood,
fidelity, friendship, all are dissipated like an
empty dream. One thing only remains-longing, longing,
insatiable longing, forever springing up anew,
pining ood thirsting. Death, which means passing
away, perishing, never awaking, their only
deliverance! Powerless the heart sinks back to
languish in longing, in longing without attaining; for
each attainment only begets new longing, until in the
last stage of weariness the foreboding of the highest
joy of dying, of no longer existing, of the last
escape into the wonderful kingdom from which we are
furthest off when we are most strenuously striving
to enter therein. Shall we call it Death? or is it the
hidden wonder world, from out of which an ivy and
vine, entwined with each other, grew up upon Triatan's
and Isolde's grave, as the legend tells us?"
<h4>292 Tristan and Isolde Liebestod</h4>
Isolden's Liebestod, or, as translated, "Isolde's
Love Death." This is the final scene of the
opera. The stage is set, a bleak courtyard of
Tristan's castle. Tristan reclines upon a couch,
wounded by Melot's sword. His henchman,
Kurwenal, has carried Tristan to this retreat,
where he is awaiting a ship bearing Isolde, who
is coming to join her wounded lover. As the 
ship arrives, Tristan, in his eagerness to see
Isolde, rises from his couch, frantically clutches
at the bandages with which his wounds are
swathed, and bleeds to death at Isolde's feet.
She tries to call her lover to life and, failing in
this, sings this death song and sinks lifeless
across his body.
<p>
This piece is tremendously popular, because of
its tuneful and emotional qualities. The title,
Liebestod (Love Death), is said to have been
given it by Franz Liszt. 
<h3>WALDTEUFEL, Emile 1837-</h3>
This famous waltz writer studied at the Paris Conservatoire.
He published his first two waltzes at his
own ezpense, and they became so popular that he
devoted his whole time to the writing of similar things,
which ran into several hundreds.
<h4>246 Charming Waltzes</h4>
So many waltzes were written by this composer
one would wonder that he did not run out of
titles. He picked the right word to describe
this set, however, and further comment is unnecessary.
<h4>247 To Thee Waltzes</h4>
No essential dance quality is lacking in this set
of waltzes, and they will be found wonderfully
effective on the organ. 
<h3>WEBER, Carl Maria von 1786-1826</h3>
Though Weber 'was a remarkable pianist, and made
many contributions to piano literature, it is with the
rise of the German opera that he is more particularly
associated, and he was the first composer to create
German musical liberty.
<p> 

Weber belonged to a large family in which there was 

considerable musical talent. His father was something
of a soldier, a player of the viola and double 

bass, and in fact was gifted along many lines. His 

mother was a good soprano singer.
<p> 

Weber took his first important musical instruction in 

1796 from J. P. Heuschkel, at that time court oboist 

and organist at Hildburghausen. Heusckkel gave him 

excellent training in piano playing. In 1798-1799 he 

studied composition, began concert playing and also 

composing, and in 1800 he wrote his first real opera, 

"Das Waldmadchen," which was followed by the
opera "Peter Schmoll" in 1801-1802. He then pursued
other studies, during which period he was closely
associated with Vogler, an accomplished organist and

musical instructor. He also met Beethoven. Haydn,
and other players of note. In 1804 Weber became
conductor at the theater in Breslau, which position he
held for two years but left owing to some unpleasantness,
particularly with his predecessor, Schnabel. He
afterwards accepted a post as secretary to Duke Ludwig
of Wurtemburg, at Stuttgart, but the Duke was
a rather irresponsible man, and the environment of
the court life at that time was rather unfavorable for
Weber. In 1810 he incurred the King's displeasure
and was banished. He then went to Mannheim and
later to Darmstadt. His mind was at this time filled
with ideas, and for the purpose of musical criticism he 
associated himself with Gottfried Weber and Meyerbeer.
In 1811-1812 he made short visits to Munich,
Prague and Berlin, and in the latter city, particularly
he was received most favourably. He was appointed
director of the Prague Theatre in 1813, but resigned
in 1816 as this post did not enable hime to fully realize
his ideals. He then accepted the directorship of the
Dresden Theatre, which place he filled in an admirable
way for a period of ten years. During his leadership
here he finished his greatest oper, "Der Freischutz"
in 1820. His health soon began to fail, and
he went to Vienna, where he wrote "Euryanthe," and
afterwards, "Oberon," In 1826 he visited England to
conduct the first appearance of the latter opera in
London, but owing to his poor health he was unable
to return and died in that city.
<h4>138 Overture to Der Freischutz</h4>
This masterpiece is one of the finest examples
of overture form. The opening eight measures
are played by a string quartette, after which the
lovely melody for horns, often referred to as
the "Prayer from Der Freischutz," is heard.
All of the themes used in the overture occur
again in the opera except the introduction and
the "Prayer." The weird theme immediately
following the "Prayer," accompanied by a
tremolo in the quartette of strings and pizzicati
notes in the basses, announces the appearance
of Samiel, the evil spirit. The restless, gloomy
air in C minor is sung by Max, the young lover.
After an episode of restlessness and uneasiness
the storm breaks in a furious tutti in which all
the instruments of the orchestra seem to try to
outdo each other. In the midst of the storm is
heard the lovely air sung by Agatha, after which
the storm continues in a brighter key-E flat
major. The overture concludes with a repetition
of the happy and triumphant song of Agatha.
<p>
This overture is regarded by many as the most
perfect overture ever written. From a standpoint
of form and orchestral scoring it is unequaled.
<h4>152 Overture to Euryanthe</h4>
This brilliant overture is about all that is ever
heard of the opera to which it belongs. As an
opera, "Euryanthe" was so completely overshadowed
by the enormous success of its predecessor,
"Der Freischutz," that it was a virtual
fiasco. Time has failed to dim the beauties of
the overture, however, and it will remain for a
long time to come a favorite number at orchestral
concerts.
<h4>161 Overture to Oberon</h4>
There are no examples of orchestration which
for careful workmanship and finish excel the
Weber overtures. This overture is a veritable
model of excellence, a paragon. As an opera,
"Oberon" stands next to "Der Freischutz" in
point of success.
<h4>342 Invitation to the Dance</h4>
A very pretty example of professional etiquette
is involved in the history of this number. A
badly mutilated version of Weber's "Der
Freischutz" was given in Paris which so aroused
the ire of the musicians that a true production
of the opera was demanded. It was necessary,
however, that the spoken dialogue be set to
music, and Berlioz was asked to do it. He
consented on the condition that the original
score and text be adhered to. The question
of a ballet arose, and when Berlioz found that
argument against it would not prevail, he
found a very happy solution of the problem in
the use of the "Invitation to the Dance."
Berlioz' orchestration is the generally accepted
orchestral arrangement, although a number of
others have been made. 
<h3>WHEELDON, H. A.</h3>
<h4>280 Cantilene</h4>
This cantilene is a very delightful composition,
and one deserving a much wider appreciation
than it enjoys. As given from the organ by this
roll, we are sure it will come into its own, for it
is lovely indeed. 
<h3>WILSON, Grenville Dean 1833-1897</h3>
Grenville D. Wilson was a native of America. Born
at Plymouth, Conn.; died at Nyack. N. Y. He composed
and taught for many years and founded a number
of choral societies. He wrote many compositions,
including some well-known songs and some piano
pieces which achieved popularity.
<h4>277 Chapel in the Mountains</h4>
This is a simple composition, bearing the title
which clearly describes the composer's programme.
Both the opening and the closing sections
are devoted to the voicing of a melody
that is simplicity itself. In the middle of the
composition there is a hymn which furnishes an
effective contrast. It was originally written as
a piano piece and has been popular many years
and is very effective on the organ. 
<h3>WOLF-FERRARI, Ermanno 1876-</h3>
Wolf-Ferrari-half German and half Italian by
parentage-was born in Venice, but most of his education
was obtained in Munich under Rheinberger. He
began composing at the age of eight and at nineteen
had finished his first opera. He is an extraordinarily
talented composer and has won fame in America and
Europe, the most popular of his operas being "The
Jewels of the Madonna."
<h4>274 Intermezzo from "Jewels of the Madonna"</h4>
This is a charming number in quick waltz time.
It begins with a wild flourish, then follow a few
bars of accompaniment as on a guitar, which is
in turn followed by a passionate love song, the
melody of which is most popular. A contrast
is then introduced with the characteristics of a
folk song. The two themes are then pitted
against each other and skillfully merged. The
finale starts with a rush, grows gentler and the
music dies softly away as in a distance
<h3>WOLSTENHOLME, William 1865-</h3>
This famous blind organist was born in Blackburn,
England. He studied orgom under Dr. Dane of the
Worcester Cathedral and the violin with Sir Edward
Elgar. Upon the advice of Elgar, he devoted his
whole time to the organ and became one of England's
best-known organists. He is now organist and choirmaster
at All Saints Church, London. Wolstenholme
obtained the Oxford degree of Bachelor of Music in 1887.
<h4>295 Canzona</h4>
This is a bit of song-like writing which is characteristic
of this composer. Its simplicity is its
charm, and its irresistible swing makes an
immediate and telling appeal. It is highly
effective as arranged in this roll.   
<h3>YON, Pietro</h3>
Pietro Yon was born in Settimo, Vittone (Piedmont,
Italy). He received his first musical instruction at
the age of six years, from Angelo Burbatti, organist
of the Cathedral at Ivrea. At fourteen he went to
Milan to study with Polibio Fumagalli of the Royal
Conservatory. In a contest for admission to the
Conservatory at Turin, he won the first scholarship
in piano, organ and composition. Four years later he
entered the Academy of St. Cecelia in Rome, and
graduated with highest honors. After two years
spent as substitute organist at the Vatican, he
accepted the appointment as organist and choirmaster
at St. Francis Xavier, New York City. His enormous
technique makes him one of the most brilliant of organists,
and his compositions bear the stamp of his
unmistakable musicianship.
<h4>341 Christmas in Sicily</h4>
The name of this composition suggests an atmosphere
no more effectively than does the
music. The Chimes are first heard in a fournote
motive, after which a delightful Siciliano
for two voices is heard. This is followed by a
lively air which is so true to its intent as to
almost make one see as well as hear the piper.
Still another theme is used over a droning bass,
giving way to the piping strain, the Siciliano
and the Chime theme. It is a delightful composition.
