<H2>Estey Organ Roll Catalog Volume 1<br>(Published circa 1925)</H2>
HTML copy: Produced by David Back. August 2017.<br>
From an original copy of "A Catalogue of Music for the ESTEY ORGAN"
<h3>1.0 THE ESTEY RESIDENCE ORGAN</h3>

Of all the musical instruments produced by man the three most distinguished are the violin,
 the piano and the pipe organ. Of these the violin still remains the instrument of the virtuoso.
 No method of playing it has yet been invented except by the slow and tedious process of
 acquiring technique. It is the instrument of the accomplished musician.
<p>
 But self-playing
 devices have been applied successfully to both the piano and the organ-but with this difference.
 Piano music derives some of its quality from the personality of the player. The touch of human
 fingers has never been exactly reproduced by mechanical devices. In some compositions the piano
 player equals the pianist, but not in all.
<p>
 The pipe organ, on the contrary, is made for automatic
 playing. There is nothing the organist can do with his hands or his feet that cannot be duplicated
 by machinery. When an organ manual is touched the resulting tone is the same, whether the touch be
 hard or soft, slow or quick. The tone continues in the same volume until the key is released.
 Brilliancy, variety and other differentqualities are obtained by other sets of pipes, and these 
 pipes are brought into play by the stops. These stops can be brought on at the proper place by
 mechanical power just as effectively as by human fingers. If the organ music is correctly cut in
 the music roll, with all the stops, couplers and swells operated at their proper places, the most
 delicate ear cannot distinguish between the human organist and the mechanical organist.
<p>
 Moreover,
 there is a quite general belief among musical people that the organ is the greatest musical
 instrument. It embraces all the instruments of the
 orchestra-even the violin and the piano. It approximates the human voice with wonderful
 fidelity. It has qualities which no other instrument has; tones which no other instrument
 produces.
<p>
 Realizing all these things, we set about making this great instrument furnish the
 music of the home. We have been organ builders for several generations. We knew the qualities
 of the organ. We knew its history. It has been installed in homes, great baronial halls, palaces,
 castles in the past. But then it required the services of a resident organist. Nor was it in
 those days so great an instrument as it is today. Bach wrote organ music which could not be
 played upon the organ as he knew it. But he also knew the organ would develop. It has.
 Not only did it develop musically as Bach dreamed. It attained possibilities Bach never dreamed.
 By means of the self-playing device anyone may now play upon the pipe organ Bach's most difficult
 composition.
<p>
 That is why we commenced to build the Estey Residence Organ. In a country like this,
 with its rapidly increasing wealth, its new homes of an almost palatial character being built daily,
 the necessary cost of a pipe organ was negligible when weighed beside its possibilities. Features
 were being added to these homes whose only purpose was to heighten the pleasurable richness of
 living in them, that cost as much as the most complete pipe organ.
<p>
 Our belief has been justified.
 The Estey Residence Organ is more and more becoming a part of the furnishing of the well-appointed
 house. It gives to its proud owner the control of an orchestra-not the passive pleasure of listening
 to a paid professional organist, not the occasional performance of some musical guest, but his own
 instrument that he plays at will, with the satisfying consciousness that what he plays could not be
 excelled by either the paid organist or the obliging guest.
<p>
 This pleasure never palls. The cost of
 the Estey Residence Organ is forgotten while the satisfaction it gives endures. It is in a business
 sense a sound investment. The pipe organ improves with age, and the upkeep is nominal. It becomes a
 permanent part of the home. It will last as long as the house lasts, and it enhances the value of the
 house. In the hands of a skillful architect or designer it becomes a beautiful addition to the music
 room, living room or hall.
<p>

<h3>2.0 MUSIC FOR THE ESTEY ORGAN</h3>

The music listed in this catalogue has been especially arranged with the greatest care for the Estey
 Residence Organ. It cannot be used on any other instrument. The music and the organ are worked out
 together and to fit each other. A corps of competent musicians is constantly at work producing music
 for the Estey Residence Organ and frequent bulletins are issued describing new compositions. From time
 to time additional volumes will be added to this catalogue, with the compositions classified and
 arranged in a convenient manner for easy reference.
<p>
 The compositions are catalogued alphabetically under two headings-by composers and by titles. The
 composers are also arranged in alphabetical order in the body of the catalogue. It has not been thought
 necessary to further classify under character of composition, such as opera, oratorio, especially
 since many compositions fall in more than one class.
 <p>
 The musical library of the Estey Residence Organ will continue to grow, guided partly by the tastes of
 the owners of the organs, and partly by our desire to present an adequate representation of the great
 and wonderful music available for the purpose. When a piece of music has been arranged for the Estey
 Organ at the request of any organ owner, that piece will be put into the bulletin, and subsequently
 into the catalogue, and will be available to any owner who cares for it.
<p>
 In selecting the compositions
 for arrangement, we have tried to cover a range that would meet the varying tastes of lovers of the
 organ, and our plan is to meet individual requirements as far as possible. We are ready to arrange
 any composition which a customer may desire, and this can be done with surprising promptness. We have
 kept in mind music especially suited to the home and such as would provide for almost any occasion, while
 at the same time furnishing a rather unusual opportunity for becoming familiar with the works of the
 greatest composers. Musical compositions can be studied with great thoroughness by the use of the Estey
 Organist, as the themes can be separated from the accompaniment and each studied separately.
 <p>

<h3>3.0 HOW TO PLAY THE ORGAN</h3>

There are three ways of playing every music roll. The first is with no effort on the part of the operator,
 beyond inserting the roll and starting the mechanism. In this way the perforations in the paper bring
 on and change the selection of stops and combinations at the proper places in the composition, and operate
 all the expression devices and the phrasing.
<p>
 With the second method the piece is pJayed with the proper
 stop combinations and expression devices operated by the perforations in the paper, while the operator
 introduces his own ideas of phrasing.
<p>
 A third way permits the operator to use his own selection of registration
 and gives him complete control over all the expression devices except the actual playing of the notes.
<p>
 None of these interferes with the playing of the organ by the hands and feet in the usual way.
<p>
 There is
 nothing intricate or mysterious about the mechanism. It is simply an application of wellproven mechanical
 principles for many years standard with all organ construction, but perfected and refined. A brief
 description of the action is given for information and guidance in order that the owner may clearly understand
 just what is done and why.
<p>
 Select the roll to be played, unfasten the cord, being sure that the paper is tightly
 rolled on the spool, and insert the pin in the left-hand end of the music roll in the spring receptacle at the
 top of the tracker box, letting the right-end pin engage in the slotted chuck at the opposite end of the
 tracker box. With the hand revolve the bottom or take-up roll until the hook in the center groove is in
 front, where the ring on the music can be easily attached. Revolve this roll, pulling off the paper from
 the spool so as to completely cover all of the holes or throats in the tracker bar, being sure that the
 paper is centered on the tracker bar. Then close the glass slide and press the &quot;on&quot; piston marked
 &quot;To Play.&quot; This permits a pressure of wind to enter the closed tracker box. Put the music in
 motion by moving the tempo pointer toward the right. As soon as the number noting the tempo of the
 composition is visible on the music roll, set the pointer on that number. When a perforation in the paper
 comes over a hole or throat in the tracker bar the wind fills this throat and tube leading from it and
 causes a small poppet at the back of the console to lift and complete an electric circuit. From then on,
 the action is that of the hand-and-foot played organ.
 <p>
 At the end of the selection a perforation registers with a throat which controls the reverse mechanism
 and the music roll is rewound. At the same time the wind is shut off from the tracker box and all stops
 and combinations which have been used are cancelled, all parts of the organ remaining at rest. When the
 rewinding is complete, the spool stops and may be removed and another inserted, in the same manner as
 before.
<p>
 When it is desired to operate the stops and ex&middot; pression devices by hand, the piston on
 the right of the tempo plate marked &quot;Stop Control&quot; should be in the &quot;off&quot; position.
 That is, the &quot;off&quot; piston should be down. It should be remembered that the stop controlled
 perforations in the paper are inoperative if this &quot;off&quot; piston is down. Inversely, when the
 paper is to control the registration and expression devices, the stop control piston &quot;on&quot; must
 be down.
<p>
 Never try to open the glass slide when wind pressure is in the tracker box. This wind pressure is
 controlled by the pistons marked &quot;To Play,&quot; &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off.&quot; It will be found
 that the &quot;off&quot; piston is automatically pushed down when the roll is being rewound and when the
 organ is at rest. Care should be taken to protect the tracker box from dust as far as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<h3>4.0 CATALOGUE OF MUSIC</h3>

<h3>BACH, Johann Sebastian 1685-1750</h3>
Leaving the name Bach out of the history of music,
there would be no history of music. This very
numerous family were prominent members of their
profession for a period of nearly two hundred years,
and so closely were they allied with the development
of musical art that the first sentence of this paragraph
becomes a truism. In all history there is not
so remarkable an example of heredity, or so strong a
refutation of the seemingly well-founded idea that
genius never repeats.
<p>
The real musical ancestor of the family was Hans
Bach, who was born about 1580 and died in 1626.
Hans had three sons deserving of mention as musicians.
One of these, Christoph, had three famous
sons, one of whom, Johann Ambrosius, was destined
to become the father of our subject, in whom the
spark of genius grew to a brilliance which is still
undimmed, nay which has grown brighter through the
years. His first lessons were given him by his father,
on the violin. At the age of ten both his parents died.
leaving him and his education in the care of his
brother, Johann Christoph, an organist at Ohrdruf.
The genius of the boy now displayed itself unmistakably,
and he progressed with a rapidity which was
not encouraged by his brother. The use of a valuable
volume of manuscript of Frohberger, Buxtchude and
other celebrated composers was forbidden to the boy,
who surreptitiously obtained it and copied it by moonlight,
spending six months at it. When the stern and
inhuman brother discovered what the youth had done,
he took away from him his hardly earned treasure.
<p>
Bach became a very great organist and was fortunate
in having his genius recognized and appreciated
during his life. His move to Leipzig in 1723 
was one of the most important events in his life, as it
gave him a position where his duties were not so exacting
that he could not devote the necessary time to
composition. He also found a musical atmosphere
which he had not known before. These ideal conditions
undoubtedly helped him produce the great works
of this period, which are among his greatest.
<p>
Many of Bach's contemporaries were skilled in the
art of polyphonic writing, and their work will stand
as exacting scrutiny from a standpoint of workmanship.
It is the musical test, however which places
Bach above all his predecessors and contemporaries.
Schumann referred to Bach as the man "to whom
music owes almost as great a debt as a religion does
to its founder." 

<h4>216 Toccata in F</h4>
Never was, nor will be, a greater toccata written
than this. To say it is the greatest of Bach's, is
the same as saying it is the greatest of all.
Words fail to describe it. It must be heard
not once or twice, but a dozen or twenty times
before its true greatness dawns upon one. It
is great musically, but marvelous structurally,
and worthy the study necessary to fathom its
depths.
 
<h4>270 Gavotte from Sixth English Suite</h4>
Tradition has it that the six English suites were
written for an English patron of Bach's and in 
the absence of any reliable data on the subject,
this guess is probably as good as any that could
be made. Bach wrote some French Suites also.
The Gavotte from the sixth English Suite is a
fine example of a form which was much in vogue
in Bach's time, and a form in which Bach was
especially skillful. The usual Musette is present
and serves as a delightful contrast to the
Gavotte proper.
<h4>284 Gavotte from Orchestral Suite in D</h4>
While the Gavotte is a dance tune of French
origin, Bach's work along this line was in no
way inferior to that of his French contemporaries.
This Gavotte differs somewhat in form
from the general plan, in that there are two
separate Gavottes, the latter one replacing the
Musette. In both forms, however, the first part
is always the concluding part also. 
<p>
<h3>BACHMANN, Georges</h3>
There is very little record available of this composer.
He wrote a large number of piano pieces, many of
which won popularity among lover, of music. He
was born about 1848; died in Paris in 1894
<h4>299 Les Sylphes</h4>
This is a familiar waltz which was very popular
with music lovers of the last generation. It is
delightfully effective on the organ and is full
of grace and charm throughout. 

<h3>BALFE, Michael William 1806-1870</h3>
This writer of so many of our favorite longs was born
in Dublin. May 15, 1808. As early as the season of
1814-1815 he was the capable violinist of the dancing
class of which his father was instructor. At seven
years of age he wrote a polacca and scored it for
Military Band. At the death of his father he became
the pupil of Chas. Edward Horn, a singer. Later
he was engaged to play in the orchestra at Drury
Lane, where he at times led the orchestra. In 1825
he went to Italy under the patronage of Count Mazzara.
Here he studied counterpoint and ringing. also
writing a successful ballet, "La Perouse." In his
twentieth year he visited Paris, and was introduced
to Rossini, who was then director of the Italian Opera.
Rossini soon discovered hia talent and offered him an
engagement for three year, as principal baritone on
the condition that he take a preparatory course with
Bordogni. His first appearance was as Figaro in the
"Barbiere," and was a decided success. From now on
he led a life of great industry, singing the baritone
roles of all the great operas, and comporing at an
astonishing rate. He died October 2O, 1870, leaving
behind a list of twenty-nine operas-twenty-one English,
five Italian and three French.
<h4>380 Then You'll Remember Me</h4>
This is a very well-known number from the
"Bohemian Girl," which is by far the best known
of Balfe's operas. It is a cavatina in form, and
occurs in the third act. It is so well known that
a description is not only unnecessary, but would
not be complimentary to music lovers.
<h3>BALL</h3>
<h4>258 Mother Machree</h4>
Perhaps the most popular of the many Irish
ballads which have been written in recent years. 
<h3>BARNBY, Joseph 1838-1896</h3>
Sir Joseph Barnby was the son of an English organist,
Thomas Barnby. He was bom at York on the
12th of August, 1838, and was a chorister at the age
of seven. In 1862 he was appointed organist of St.
Andrew's. London, and the services at this church
became famous under his direction. He is chiefly
known for his numerous compositions in choral form.
His works include an oratorio-"Rebekah"-and two
hundred and forty-six hymn tunes, which were all published
under one cover in 1897. He was also famous
as a conductor of Barnby's Choir, and later succeeded
Gounod as conductor of the Albert Hall
Choral Society. He died in London on the 28th of
January, 1896.
<h4>237 Sweet and Low</h4>
This is a setting of Tennyson's lines:
"Sweet and low, sweet and low, wind of the western
sea,
Low, low, breathe and blow, wind of the western sea.
Over the rolling waters go,
Come from the dying moon and blow, 

Blow him again to me, 

While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps." 

<h3>BARTLETT, James Carroll 1850-</h3>
This composer of many meritorios songs was born in
Harmony, Maine, July 14,1850. He entered the New
England Conservatory in 1869, where he studied
piano and voice. He became later a pupil of Shakespeare
and developed into a fine tenor. He toured this
country in 1875-1876 with Camilla Urso, and was
later musical director for Booth and Barrett. Many
of his songs occupy a regular place on concert programmes.
<h4>278 A Dream</h4>
A song with a melodious beauty which has
caught the popular fancy, and bids fair to retain
its popularity for some time to come

<h3>BATISTE, Edouard 1820-1876</h3>
Batiste was a very renowned French organist, perhaps
the best of his time. Like most eminent French musicians.
he got his education at the Conservatoire of
Paris. His compositions stand high in popular favor,
but they fall far below what might be expected from
an executant of his unusual ability. He wrote very
little, if anything, except for the organ.
<h4>181 Communion in G</h4>
A melody such as one would suspect had been
written for the organ. It is anything but elaborate
in the beginning, depending solely on the
delightful tune with plain harmonies for its
attractiveness. Then the same subject is
treated with various sorts of ornamentation,
forming a very interesting contrast to the first
part. It concludes with a quiet repetition of
the theme with a slightly different harmonization.

<h4>232 Offertoire St. Cecilia Op. 8 No.2 in D</h4>
This is one of a number of "Offertoires" by
Batiste which have become immensely popular
among organists, especially for concert purposes.
It is a simple melody of great beauty,
which is subjected to much elaboration, not to
the detriment of the melody however, for Batiste
knew when to stop. The present roll
plays this number in a way seldom equaled by
hand playing because of certain technical difficulties
which are of course of no consequence
to the automatic mechanism. 

<h3>BEETHOVEN, Ludwig van 1770-1827</h3>
What can be said in a paragraph of this Titan about
whom literally dozens of whole volumes have been
written? One might venture the opinion that he was
the greatest of all composers with very little chance
of overstating the truth. He invented the sonata
form as we know it, and then wrote symphonies in that
form as if to prove it the greatest and best of all forms.
All the hardships necessary to the development of a
great genius were Beethoven's; he knew the sting of
hunger more than once, and poverty was his portion
for many years. A drunken father and the death of
his mother and sister added to his misery. It may be
that the troubles that were his in early life furnish the
reason for the fact that, as compared with Mozart,
Mendelssohn and others, he wrote practically nothing
of importance until he was twenty-five or twenty-six.
<h4>126 Adagio Cantabile-Sonata Pathetique</h4>
This is a lovely example of wonderful thematic
beauty combined with masterful workmanship.
Like most of Beethoven's themes, it is simplicity
itself; indeed, this is its charm. It is from
one of Beethoven's early sonatas, but a famous
one, "Pathetique." As an effective organ number
it is unexcelled.


<h4>219 Symphony Op. 21-Andante Cantabile</h4>
This is the slow movement of Beethoven's first
symphony, written sometime before April, 1800.
Nothing need be said about the charm of a
Beethoven slow movement, whether it be from
a sonata, string quartette or symphony. In this
style of writing he gave his genius a free rein,
and his wonderful technique of composition
permitted him to put down what many another
man might have thought, but never could have
expressed as Beethoven did.
This first symphonic slow movement gives
many indications as to what might be expected
of him in the future, and his style and individuality
never changed to a point which would
make this movement unrecognizable as Beethoven's
work.
<h4>265 Minuet in G</h4>
This is a lovely unattached minuet which deserves
to belong to a symphony, quartette, or
sonata. It suffers little in popularity, however,
as a result of its not having a "home"; in fact,
it is quite possible it is better known than would 
be the case if it were a part of one of the above
forms. Beethoven wrote it! What more can
be said by way of recommendation.
<h4>322 Andante con Moto (Fifth 
Symphony)</h4>
The Fifth Symphony was begun about 1805 and
had its first production December 22, 1808, at
a concert given by Beethoven consisting entirely
of works of his own which had never before been
heard in public. The affair was a fiasco, due to
the length of the programme, the extreme difficulty
of the music, the intense cold in the unheated
theatre, and an actual breakdown in a
choral fantasie which was one of the numbers.
In spite of such an inauspicious premier performance,
the Fifth Symphony has become perhaps
the most popular of all symphonies. There
is nothing more beautiful in music than a Beethoven
slow movement, and few, if any of his,
surpass this one. The organ roll does it full
justice. 

<h3>BIZET, Georges 1838-1875</h3>
Bizet, whose proper name was Alexandre Cesar
Leopold Bizet, was one of the really great modern
French composers. From 1848 to 1857 he was one
of the most distingmshed pupils at the Conservatoire,
where he studied piano, organ, harmony and composition,
the latter branch under no less a personage Halevy,
whose daughter he married in 1869. He had his share of
disappointments before getting the recognition he deserved.
Carmen, his masterpiece, conquered the whole world.
It was produced first at the Opera Comique, March 3, 1875.
It did not meet with instant success, but its genuine merit
was not to be denied as it won a lasting place among
the standard grand operas.

<h4>845 Carmen Fantasie No.1</h4>
This long roll is a source of delight from beginning
to end. It properly begins with the introduction
to the opera, after which the stately
Toreador Song appears. The principal airs of
the first act follow in about the order in which
they appear in the opera. The wonderful
Habanera; the street boys' chorus; the lovely
air by Michaela; and in fact all the gems of the
first act are included. In this arrangement this
beautiful music is heard at its best, and it would
be difficult to find one to dispute the statement
made in the first sentence of this paragraph. 

<h3>BOCCHERINI, Luigi 1743-1805</h3>
Boccherini was the son of a bass player, who gave him 

his fird musical instruction on the cello. At fourteen 

he was sent to Rome to study, and his progress both 

in playing and composition very soon made him 
famous.
<p> 

In 1764 he returned to Lucca, the place of his birth, 

where he became a member of the theatre orchestra 

and town band. 
<p>
He was one of the most indefatigable composers, and 

despite his great popularity, he died in abject poverty
May 28, 1805.
<p>

The list of his compositions seems incredible. including
as it does 125 quintettes, 91 quartettes, 54 trios, 

all for strings, besides 42 trios for other instruments, 

12 pianoforte quintettes, 18 quintettes for various 

other instruments, 20 symphonies, 2 octettes, violin 

duos, sonatas, cello concertos, and sacred music.
<p> 

He was contemporaneous with Haydn, with whom he 

shares the honor of being the father of the string 

quartette. 

<h4>840 Minuet Celebre</h4>
This minuet is one of the charming bits of
writing so characteristic of the composer. Its
daintiness is its chief charm, though it lacks
nothing in the way of strictly musical worth.
It is perhaps the best-known bit of writing by
this composer. 

<h3>BRAGA, Gaetano</h3>
This composer is a distinguished Italian cellist. He
was born in the Abruzzi and was a pupil of the Naples
Conservatory. He traveled extensively and has made
several European concert tours. Besides compositions
for the violoncello, he has written some operas
and chamber music.
<h4>266 Angels' Serenade</h4>
The popularity of this number has, in many
years, shown no signs of lessening. The theme
is of an appealing sort, and the words contain
a pretty sentiment. Altogether it is a charming
number and one deserving of the popular
approval it has so long enjoyed. 

<h3>BRAHMS, Johannes 1833-1897</h3>
This composer was born in Hamburg, May 7, 1833;
died in Vienna, April 3, 1897. His first instruction
in music was given by his father, who was a member
of the Orchestra of the Stadt Theatre, Hamburg, but
his principal musical training was under Marxsen of
Altona. He made his debut as pianist when but fourteen
years old and shortly thereafter made a concert
tour with Remenyi. the violinist, but it is as a composer
that Brahms is best known. Some of his friends
in their zeal pitted him against Wagner. and precipitated
an artistic battle between the two, which was
distasteful to both. He occupies a place in the
musical world as a master.
<h4>261 Capriccioso</h4>
This is a delightful little thing written for the
piano, and will serve to show the wonderful
effectiveness of the organ in rendering a number
which is so obviously piano music. Its
musical value is really enhanced as a number of
pretty figures which may be lost on the piano,
because of the single tone color, are brought to
the surface-so to speak-on the organ in a
way quite impossible to any other instrument.
<h4>310 Hungarian Dance No. 1</h4>

<h4>311 Hungarian Dance No. 2</h4>

<h4>312 Hungarian Dance No. 4</h4>

<h4>300 Hungarian Dance No. 6
</h4>
Many composers have felt the wild and weird
charm of Magyar (Hungarian) music to the
extent that they were moved to write something
in this style. Some of them, undoubtedly, were
unconsciously obeying certain racial instincts,
while others were simply moved by a care-free
style in which they could give expression in
unrestrained and almost formless fashion to
certain moods which could not be adequately
expressed in strictly orthodox forms.
The peculiarities discoverable in what we know
as Hungarian music are traceable to certain
characteristics in the music of two distinct peoples.
To the Magyars-the true Hungarians-belongs
the rhythm, which is unique because of
its almost incessant syncopation, consisting generally
of the accentuation of the second eighth
note of the measure of 2-4 time. This rhythm
is known as "alIa zoppa" (in a limping way).
The gypsies are responsible for the numerous
embellishments, without which Hungarian

music would not, to us, be Hungarian. These
two qualities have been so intimately linked
together for so long a time that they have
become concomitants and are now inseparable.
Thus it is seen that the gypsies, while enjoying
the honor of being the composers of this charming
music, simply took the real Hungarian
music, added certain ornaments of their own,
and produced what has come to be regarded as
a national style.
In other words, they did what Homer did according
to Kipling:
<p>
When 'Omer smote 'is bloomin' lyre,<br>
'e'd 'eard men sing on land and sea,<br>
And what 'e thought 'e might require,<br>
'e went and took-same as me.
<p>
The market-girls an' fishermen, <br>
The shepherd an' the sailors, too,
<br>
They 'eard old songs turn up again,<br>
But kep' it quite-same as you!
<p>
They knew 'e stole; 'e knew they knowed,<br>
They didn't tell, nor make a fuss,<br>
But winked at 'Omer down the road,<br>
An' 'e winked back-the same as us!
<p>
The Brahms Hungarian dances are standard,
and a description of anyone of them would
serve as adequate comment on all. They possess
all the characteristics, peculiar and otherwise,
of the style, and may be taken as models
of their kind. Number 6 is perhaps the most
popular of the set, but the others are no less
interesting. Their beauties are brought out by
the rolls in an unusually satisfactory manner.
<h3>BREWER, John Hyatt 1858-</h3>
John Hyatt Brewer is a well-known American organist
who began his musical career as a boy soprano,
and served several New York churches in this capacity.
He studied harmony with Navarro and organ
with Buck and others. He is known as a fine organist.
and a capable chorus director as well as a composer
of many works for organ. He has also written
numerous songs, glees, and choral works.
<h4>308 Echo Bells</h4>
This composition has been arranged especially
for a pleasing introduction of the chimes. It is,
however, very effective on organs in which the
chimes are not included, where the effect of
chimes is produced by other combinations. 

<h3>BUCK, Dudley 1889-1909</h3>
Dudley Buck was the son of a Hartford (Connecticut)
merchant, who planned that Dudley should follow
a mercantile life. He discovered his son's musical
ability, however, and showed commendable judgment in
sparing no effort to make of him a musician. Buck
was one of the greatest American composers, and has
left us a rich heritage of compositions in various
forms. While he wrote voluminously for male and
mixed choruses, he did not neglect the orchestra, and
was at one time assistant conductor of the Theodore
Thomas Orchestra. He was for many years America's
premier organist, and wrote much for the organ.
<h4>149 At Evening, Idylle, Op. 52</h4>
It is doubtful if any of the organ works of this
composer has met with the degree of approbation
from musicians and the general public
which this number enjoys. It is beautifully
sentimental, and when one is in the mood to
enjoy a pastoral such as this, nothing could surpass
it in its quiet effectiveness. This American
composer has endeared himself to the public
largely through his anthems, of which he has
written a very large number.

<h4>313 Home, Sweet Home 
(Transcription)</h4>

The authorship of this lovely melody, which we
know by the above name, is much in doubt. It
has been ascribed to Sir Henry Bishop, and to
Thomas Moore. It was published early in the
last century under the title, "To the Home of
My Childhood," and the melody ascribed to
Sicilian origin.
<p>
Sir Henry Bishop used this supposed Sicilian
melody in his opera "CIari," or the "Maid of
Milan," in 1828. Later he confessed to William
Chappell and others that he was the real composer
of the melody. What a condescension!
Incidentally, who would not like to make such
a "confession"!
<p>
It may be said to the credit of Buck, that in his
transcription for the organ he has done nothing
to destroy the innate beauty of the melody, but
rather has woven about it a very pretty figure
of embroidery which serves only to add to the
loveliness of the theme by contrast. 

<h3>CARYLL, Ivan</h3>
<h4>363 Wait Till the Cows Come Home</h4>
This is a number from Jack O'Lantern in which
the comedian, Fred Stone, is the star. As arranged
it is intended as a fox trot, and as such
has become very popular. We believe this roll
will be found to meet all the requirements of
dance music, as it lacks none of the snap of an
orchestral rendition. 

<h3>CHAMINADE, Cecile 1861-</h3>
A brilliant pianiste and a composer of very many
piano pieces highly esteemed for the dainty style so
characteristic of the French school. At eight years
of age her first efforts at composition resulted in some
church music. Since then her writing has been mostly
for the piano, and her pieces have been popularized
by her own playing of them as well as by their inherent
merit. She has also written many songs, and a
number of more pretentious works, but is chiefly
known as a composer for the piano.
<h4>190 Water Sprites</h4>
This is one of a great many beautiful piano
pieces by this prolific composer. It is charmingly
characteristic of her, and is a good example
of the dainty style in which the French
excel. Most delightful effects are easily obtainable
on the organ with this roll, and a surprise
is in store for anyone possessed of the idea that
piano pieces cannot be adapted to the organ.
Compositions for the piano have been successfully
adapted to the orchestra, and what is an
organ but an orchestra?

<h4>301 Scarf Dance, Callirhoe Suite</h4>
The Scarf Dance is the second of four numbers
comprising the Callirhoe Suite for orchestra, a
ballet mst produced in 1888. Like most of
Chaminade's work, its charm lies chiefly in its
daintiness.
After the opening part, which is so well known,
there is a delightful theme of Oriental character
which is in appropriate contrast to the
beginning and adds tremendously to the interest.
The opening part is then used as a conclusion.
To those familiar with this number as
played by the orchestra, this roll will be found
highly satisfactory, while to those who know it
only as a piano piece it will be a revelation. 

<h3>CHOPIN, Francois Frederic 1809-1849</h3>
This composer is known to the world by his piano
compositions. He wrote practically nothing else
except a few songs. His piano compositions, however,
are enough to immortalize him. So important are
they that it would be almost impossible to find a piano
recital programme without one or more Chopin numbers.
Perhaps his waltzes and nocturnes are best
known to the laity, but the mazurkas, polonaises and
ballads are known and played by all great artists.
<h4>116 Funeral March</h4>
This impressive funeral march is from a piano
sonata, Op. 35, and is much the best-known
movement of the sonata. The opening series
of chords are as melancholy as one could wish
them to be, and then the sombreness is well
relieved by the lovely plaintive melody which
forms the trio. The tinge of sadness is as
apparent, however, in the trio as in the opening
and closing movements, which are practically
alike. 
<h3>DEBUSSY, Claude Achille 1862-</h3>
Debussy may be considered the founder of what we
call the modern French school. He is probably the
best-known exponent of the full tone scale, that is
to say, in many of his melodies he makes use of steps
of a full tone, instead of adhering to the diatonic
scale of the key indicated by the signature, which is
composed of tones and semi tones. His work has created
much discussion which has brought no result
except to bring forth very rabid expressions for or
againat it.
<h4>249 "Clair de Lune" (Moonlight)</h4>
One of the lovely piano pieces by this composer,
the exquisite charm of which is largely due to its
simplicity. It is as soothing as moonlight, and
dreamy enough to suit the most exacting
sentimentalist. 
  
<h3>DELIBES, Clement Philibert Leo 1836-1891</h3>
This French composer is best known by his fascinating
ballet music, of which he has written much. He received
his musical education at the Paris Conservatoire,
and eventually became Professor of Advanced
Composition in that institution. A large number of
operas were written by him, and some of them occupy
a regular place in the repertoires of many opera
houses. France has produced no greater writer of
dance music.
<h4>139 Intermezzo-Pas des Fleurs (Naila)</h4>
This is a charming bit of writing of a distinctly
French flavor, and of a style in which Delibes
had no superior.
<h4>155 "Pizzicati" and "Valse Lente" from "Sylvia"</h4>
The two numbers on this roll are from a grand
mythological ballet which was produced June
14, 1876, and any doubt which may have existed
as to Delibes' ability as a dance music
writer were at once dispelled. 
<p>
The first movement is, as its name would indicate,
played by plucking the strings of all the
stringed instruments in the orchestra. This
effect is wonderfully duplicated on the organ
and the result is a charmingly satisfactory
rendition.
<p>
The Valse Lente is one of a type that could have
been written by no one but a Frenchman, and
indeed few Frenchmen could have done it.
Nothing in the way of the grace so characteristic
of this composer is lacking, and as a lovely
bit of ballet music it is unexcelled. 

<h3>DONIZETTI, Gaetano 1797-1848</h3>
This prolific composer was contemporaneous with
Rossini. and while he wrote much of merit and in the
true Italian style of his day, he achieved little in the
way of public recognition until after Rossini, who
was five years his senior, had ceased to compose. His
greatest successes are "Lucia di Lammermoor" which
contains the famous sextette; "Lucrezia Borgia"
and "La Favorita" out of a complete list of
sixty-six or sixty-seven.
<h4>185 Sextette from Lucia di Lammermoor</h4>

It is doubtful if any single piece of music exceeds
this number in popularity. Although
originally written for six voices, so well does it
lend itself to various forms of instrumental
adaptation that it has been arranged in every
conceivable form. It is a particular favorite
with concert bands, when the six parts are taken
by various solo instruments accompanied by
the full band. It is extremely effective on the
organ, and invariably gives pleasure.
<h3>DRDLA, Franz</h3>
One of the most popular composers for the violin is
this Bohemian who was born in Prague. He has spent
about twenty-five years in Vienna, much of this time
being spent as concert master of the Royal Opera
House. He is a very fine violinist, as both his compositions
and position would indicate, and a very prolific
composer of small numbers, the most popular of
which are well known in America. Being only a little
past middle age, much more may be expected of him
in the way of delightful writing, quite equal to the
standard he has set by that portion of his work which
is known in America.
<h4>349 Souvenir</h4>
This is one of the numerous compositions for
violin and piano by this Bohemian violinist.
Incidentally it is characteristic of the school to
which Drdla belongs. The extreme rubato
savors of the Bohemian school, as it does of the
Hungarian school. Altogether it is a charming
bit of writing and the string stops of the organ
give it from this roll in a way that is no less
pleasing than a violin rendition. 

<h3>DUBOIS, Francois Clement Theodore 1837-</h3>
Dubois at an early age left the place of his birth
-Rosney-and went to Paris to enter the Conservatoire,
where he successively took the prizes for harmony,
fugue and organ, later, in 1861, taking the
much-coveted Prix de Rome. His compositions cover
all forms from song to symphony and grand opera.
but he is best known in this country for his organ
compositions.
<h4>229 Cantilene Nuptiale</h4>
This is a very good sample of the delicious
melody of which Dubois is capable. Like
most compositions by this composer, it was
written for the organ, and is extremely effective
as played by the present roll.
<h4>291 March of the Magi Kings</h4>
This is an exceptionally unique bit of programme
music. The high sustained note which
is heard throughout the march is intended to
represent the ever present guiding star. It is
an extremely interesting composition aside
from its programme claims. 
<h4>279 March Heroique de Jeanne d'Arc</h4>
Little, if anything, has been done by this celebrated
French composer that is more interesting
than this March Heroique. Certain programme
effects have been attempted as in the
case of the "March of the Magi Kings"; the
voice of Jeanne being heard at intervals in this
case. It is a delightful bit of writing and meets
all the requirements of discriminating musicians
as well as the lover of music.
<h4>234 Toccata in G Major</h4>
The earliest examples of the Toccata form are
those of Giovanni Gabrieli, 1557-1613. These
examples are rather restricted in form, and seldom
make use of chords even for accompanimental
purposes. The original idea was developed
and elaborated upon from time to time
until Bach placed the form upon the solid basis
which it now occupies. Most composers of
organ music have included one or more Toccatas
in their list, and the present one is deserving
of the popularity it enjoys. Being an organ
composition, it is of course effective when
played from the roll. 
<h4>282 In Paradisum</h4>
This is strictly an organ composition, wherein
the beauty of the theme is more prominent than
its brilliancy. At the beginning the accompaniment
is of a celestial harp. The theme
develops into a choral-like chant, to indicate the
chant of the angels. The harp used in this
composition gives a most beautiful effect.
<h3>DVORAK, Antonin 1841-1904</h3>
This composer has endeared himself to the American
public by his "New World" symphony. After hearing
the negroes of the South sing some of their characteristic
songs, he thought he had discovered the
basis for an American school of composition, and proceeded
to put his ideas into effect. The result is this
wonderful symphony, which is perhaps more popular
than any written in recent years. He wrote it during
his stay in America as the director of the National
Conservatory of New York, and Americans are proud
that such a masterpiece should have been written in
this country.
<p>
Dvorak's theories with regard to the value of negro
music in serious work have been the occasion of much
controversy. A hearing of the symphony, however, is
apt to settle any dispute, and bring about an agreement
that it is highly enjoyable and likely to live.
<h4>175 Humoreske, Op. 101, No.7</h4>
Dvorak has been known to students and attendants
at orchestra concerts for many years. His
New World Symphony endeared him to American
musicians, despite the controversy it created.
The Humoreske, however, is the dainty little
conceit that brought him the recognition of the
masses. It is one of the big little things no one
but a great man could write.
 
<h4>145 Adagio, Allegro Molto. First Movement from New World Symphony</h4>
The fact that this symphony was written in this
country is the occasion of a considerable amount
of pride to Americans. It is a great work, and
whether the claim of the composer to have discovered
in the negro folk song a basis for an
American school of composition is exemplified,
matters not. It can be enjoyed from a musical
standpoint regardless of any opinions one may
have as to its origin. It is enough that the negro
melodies should have inspired so wonderful a
work.
<h4>146 Largo. Second Movement, New World Symphony</h4>
This is thought by many people to be the best
movement of the four comprising the symphony.
The wonderfully sad and plaintive first theme
is doubtless the occasion of this opinion. As a
matter of fact, the other movements are quite as
good, but they are not so obvious-they require
a few more hearings to be understood. Nothing
could excel the first theme of this number, however,
which in the orchestra is an English horn
solo for four measures, then it continues as a
duet with the clarinet. Presently the strings
have it for eight measures, when the English
horn takes it up again with the bassoon. The
French horns lead up to the second theme which
is in strong contrast, paving the way for a reentrance
of the first theme with which the movement
finishes.
<h4>147 Scherzo. Third Movement, New World Symphony</h4>
Scherzo is an Italian word, meaning "jest,"
therefore a scherzo is a composition of a sportive
and playful character. One playing of this roll
will suffice to show how well Dvorak has caught
the jesting spirit. Here and there he stops his
chatter to sing a plaintive little tune for which
the ear is wholly unprepared, but which is no
less welcome or beautiful on that account, returning
to the funny part of his musical story
only to interpolate another contrasting tune.
Then the story closes after a fine working down
from the climax to a scarcely audible pianissimo,
with a crashing chord by the full orchestra. 
<h4>148 Allegro confuoco. Fourth Movement, New World Symphony</h4>
No less interesting than the others is this last
movement of the New World Symphony. At
the tenth measure begins the principal theme of
the movement, a theme big and broad, and well
adapted to the thematic treatment it is to receive
later on. Presently the second theme is heard
in the strings with wood wind accompaniment,
after which portions of both are developed in a
most fascinating manner. An interesting feature
is the curious introduction into this movement
of parts of both the Second and Third
Movements. They are heard distinctly at about
the middle of the roll and near the end. Truly
this is a fitting finale to a great work, an example
of wonderful workmanship, and destined to
become a classic.

<h3>ELGAR, Sir Edward 1857-</h3>
This remarkable composer, the son of a fine organist,
was born at Broadheath, June 2, 1857. His musical
proclivities asserted themselves early in life, and
before he was fifteen he had often substituted for his
father at the organ. A plan to send him to Leipsic
failed, and Elgar's musical education was thrust upon
him by a series of circumstances which, in all probability,
broadened his musical vision to an extent that
would have been impossible had he followed a strictly
ordered course of study. There is scarcely an instrument
in the orchestra that he did not learn to play,
the wonderful color effects of his orchestral writings
being undoubtedly due to his unusual practical knowledge
of each of these instruments. A list of his compositions
includes nearly all the accepted forms, done
in a very charming but generally very informal way. 
<h4>287 "Pomp and Circumstance"-Op. 39, No.1 (Military March)</h4> 
Of all the marches under this title, of which
there are six, none matches its name better than
this one, in D. Its pompous beginning and
ending are wonderfully contrasted with the
imposing middle theme, which is of the kind
that makes one's feet keep time whether he
will or not.  
<h4>365 Salut d'Amour</h4>
There has probably been nothing written in
recent years of really good quality which has
caught the popular fancy to the extent that this
little love song enjoys. It is played as a violin
solo, cello solo, and is an indispensable part of
every organist's repertoire. It can be heard to
no greater advantage than on the organ, and
this roll does it in a way superior to the best
hand-played rendition. 
<h3>FAURE, Jean-Baptiste 1830</h3>
Jean-Baptiste Faure was born in Moulins, January
15, 1830. His father was a singer, and the son followed
his footsteps. He has written several songs, of
which The Palms is best known, and some books of
instruction in the art of singing. He created many of
the baritone parts in the operas written during the
time of his public activity, which ceased about
1878-1880. 
<h4>33l The Palms<h4> 
This is much the best known of the several songs
by this composer. It has become a part of the
Palm Sunday service in most churches and furnishes
an opportunity for the di~play of a fine baritone
voice such as is found in few songs
<h3>FLAGLER, Isaac Van Vleck 1844-1909</h3>
Was born in Albany, N. Y., May 15, 1844. He
studied music first in his native city and then in
Paris with Edouard Batiste. He occupied important
positions as organist after his return to this country,
in Chicago, Poughkeepsie, Albany and Auburn. He
also taught music in the Syracuse and Cornell universities
and at the Utica Conservatory. He composed
and collected considerable organ music, which
is held in high esteem. He died in Auburn in 1909.
<h4>290 Serenata</h4>
This is just such a melody as the name would
indicate, and one characteristic of this wellknown
American organist. 
<h4>289 Impromptu</h4>
A dainty thing, replete with lovely harmonies
and charming melody. It is lacking of any
particular form, but no less interesting on that
account. 
<h4>275 Gavotte</h4>
A pleasing example of an old dance form. It
is tuneflll and is not lacking in the swing so
characteristic of this form. 

<h3>FLOTOW, Friedrich Freiherr von 1812-1883</h3>
His father intended him to enter the diplomatic service,
but like many another father, he was disappointed.
The boy had something in him that precluded
any other pursuit than music. Music was at
its best in Paris in 1827, the time of Flotow's first
visit to that city, and the artistic life which surrounded
him brought him to a realization of his own
musical talent. He began to study with Reicha. He
remained in Paris until the revolution of 1830 drove
him away. He could not stay away long, as he found
the gay life of Paris a necessary stimulus to his work.
He wrote about twenty operas, of which practically
only two, "Martha," and "Stradella," are known to
the present generation. 
<h4>198 Overture to "Martha"</h4>
This tuneful overture to Flotow's most popular
opera has since its first performance in 1847
been a favorite with the public. While it possesses
merit to those inclined to look below the
surface, it is its melodious quality which endears
it to the public. Martha and Stradella, out of
nearly twenty, are about the only Flotow
operas ever produced now. These two, however,
are destined to enjoy many more years of
popular favor. 
<h4>314 Overture to Stradella</h4>
This opera was first performed at the Palais
Royal Theatre in Paris as a lyric drama. Flotow
then recomposed it as a grand opera and
produced it at Hamburg, December 30, 1844,
as "Alessandro Stradella." The overture is particularly
tuneful, and is perhaps as well known
as the Overture to Martha by the same composer.
The first part is one of the most dignified
of Flotow's efforts, and is better known
than the rest of the overture, being much used
as an organ voluntary.
<p>
Taken in its complete form as we have it on the
roll, it is one of the best of the lighter overtures.
<h3>FRANCK, Cesar 1822-1890</h3>
Cesar Franck was a Belgian by birth but a Frenchman
by choice and adoption. After his studies at the
Paris Conservatoire he returned to his native country
for the short period of two years, then moved his
family to Paris where he established himself permanently
in 1844. His unusually strong constitution
permitted him to work at a pace that few men could
have equaled. Day after day he gave ten lessons of
one hour each, beside laying the foundation for the
enormous amount of composing he was to do later in
life. He was a most kindly and lovable man, and
lived his life for his music and his friends, always too
busy to give any attention to the unkind criticism of
his musical enemies, of whom he had many. He was
the chief exponent of a new school of composition, and
he cared little what was said about any of his work
that passed his own exacting scrutiny and had the
approval of his small but very select coterie.
The very large number of compositions he left include
all the established forms; Symphonies. Oratorios,
Symphonic Poems; Cantatas, Biblical scenes, Operas
and Chamber music, numerous pieces for the organ,
piano and songs.
Much of this charming music is unknown to the public.
but it bids fair to come into its own. The gorgeous
Symphony in D minor now occupies the place on
orchestra programmes which it deserves, and organists
are discovering that they have overlooked much
that is worthy of their attention. Surely a very high
place among the composers belongs to this man, and
before many years his name will occupy the exalted
position it deserves. 
<h4>356 Andantino</h4>
Here is an example of unadorned beauty. The
simplest of themes is used and the whole structure
stands solely on its innate loveliness. Of
course it could not be expected that a master
contrapuntalist such as Franck was, should
eliminate all evidences of his marvelous technique
of composition, but he has resorted to so
little in the way of development or ornamentation
that the result is all the more surprising.
It is an altogether lovely bit of writing, such as
only a man of Franck's character could have
done. 
<h3>FREY, Hugo</h3>
<h4>364 When You Come Back</h4>
This is one of the most popular of the many war
songs which are in vogue just now. The present
arrangement is a one step, and is very popular
as a dance number. The composer is leader
of a well-known New York dance orchestra and
has written a number of things which have
caught on with the public. 
<h3>GERMAN, J. Edward 1862-</h3>
German is considered by many to be the successor of
Sir Arthur Sullivan. His remarkable gift of melody
and his ability to clothe his catchy themes with appropriate
harmony have won for him a lasting place in
the musical world. He has written a number of suites
of incidental music to Shakespearean plays which have
excited a wide interest. Two symphonies occupy an
important place among his longer works.
<h4>158 Country Dance-Nell Gwyn</h4>
One of three dances from the music to "Nell
Gwyn," which was first produced in London in
1900. German is one of the best-known English
composers and has given us here a dance of
remarkable grace and freshness, and strikingly
characteristic of his ability.
<h4>335 Shepherd's Dance</h4>
<h4>334 Morris Dance</h4>
<h4>326 Torch Dance</h4>
The music which German had composed for
Richard Mansfield's production of Richard III 
was of such a superior quality that when in 1892
Sir Henry Irving presented Henry VIII, German
was commissioned to write the incidental
music. The result is quite equal to the first
effort, and we present here three dances which
have become famous as concert numbers, and
justly so. They are all charming numbers, and
the organ is the ideal instrument for their performance.
<h3>GIBSON, Archer 1875-</h3>
Was born in Baltimore and received his early instruction
at home. He later studied piano and organ
under Harold Randolph at the Peabody Conservatory
in that city. After holding important positions
in Baltimore. he went to New York in 1901, becoming
organist at the Brick Presbyterian Church on Fifth
Avenue. He devotes his entire time at present to
concert work and is probably the most brilliant of
American organists.
<h4>268 Elegy</h4>
The sadness of this melody is one of its greatest
charms. It is heard at the beginning and
after a lovely middle part, which is in great
contrast, the first theme is again heard, clothed
with the same harmonies, but on a different solo
stop. The change thus effected comes to a
fitting close, completing a very charming number
<h3>GODARD, Benjamin 1849-1895</h3>
This French composer has enriched our musical heritage
by many works of extreme beauty and refinement.
His chief work is the "Damnation de Faust," which
betrays his mastery of orchestration. Most of us
know him best by his songs, and pieces in shorter form
for piano, violin, etc., in which his wonderful gift of
melody is a striking characteristic. A number of
operas and symphonies, as well as other larger works.
are better known in Europe than in America.
<h4>170 Berceuse from Jocelyn</h4>
Comparatively few of the thousands of American
admirers of this lovely lullaby are aware
that it is an excerpt from an opera. Such is the
case, however, and it is a fine example of the
composer's ability along lyric lines. It has the
sentimental quality which sings itself into one's
soul, and has become the great favorite it is by
force of sheer merit.
<h4>308 Solitude</h4>
The title of this number is apposite enough in
so far as the first and last parts are concerned,
but the middle part is apt to suggest anything
else than Solitude. For instance, it might suggest
the ponderous footsteps of an elephant in
the jungle, and the chattering of a lot of
monkeys. Or it might serve well to depict a
cave full of gnomes and bats,-a dark stage,
villains, etc. After all, what's in a name? This
is a charming bit of music and will doubtless
suggest a different thought to each of its
hearers.
<h3>GOLDMARK, Karl</h3>
Goldmark early gave promise by his violin playing.
He was sent to Vienna in 1844 to study in earnest.
The work which brought him seriously before the public
as a composer was the overture, "Sakuntala."
His "Queen of Sheba" is the greatest of his operas.
Goldmark's complete mastery over every musical
effect, together with his wealth of melody, makes his
works altogether charming.
<h4>226 Overture, "Sakuntala"</h4>
At the first production of this overture in
Vienna, the public realized that a new star had
arisen. The overture is founded on a Sanskrit
drama, and the story has to do with the gift of
a ring by the King to Sakuntala by which she is
to be recognized as his wife. She loses the ring
while washing clothes in the sacred river, and
when presented to the King he repudiates her
because of the absence of the ring. Some fishermen
find the ring and return it to the King who
then remembers Sakuntala, and is filled with
grief and remorse. He finally finds Sakuntala
again, and the joy of both is complete. 
<h3>GOTTSCHALK, Louis Moreau 1829-1869</h3>
This perhaps most famous American pianist was born
in New Orleans of an English father and a French
mother. He studied the piano merely as an accomplishment
until the age of twelve, when he prevailed
upon his parents, who were in easy circumstances, to
allow him to go to Paris to take up music seriously.
When financial reverses overtook his father, he turned
his talent to good account, and traveled eztensively
giving concerts. He was the idol of many countries,
including his own. No other pianist has traveled as
eztensively or played to as many people. He died
suddenly in Rio de Janeiro.
<h4>172 Last Hope</h4>
This composition is said to have been played by
Gottschalk extemporaneously at the request of
his benefactress, Mme. S---, who, mourning
the absence of her only son, and being afflicted
with an incurable disease, could only forget her
suffering in listening to the playing of her dear
Moreau. "In pity, my dear Moreau, one little
melody, the last hope."
<p>
It is upon this lovely composition that Gottschalk's
fame as a composer rests. The theme
has been adapted to church uses by its arrangement
into a hymn.
<h3>GOUNOD, Charles Francois 1818-1893</h3>
Gounod may be said to have inherited his talent, as his
mother was a distinguished pianiste. In 1836 he
entered the Conservatoire, and in 1837 wrote a cantata
which brought him the aecond prize. He became
an organist and his experience with choirs is doubtless
responsible for his fine choral writing. His naturally
refined disposition ahows in all his works, and
he rarely wrote anything below a certain dignified
atandard which he seems to have aet for himself.
"Faust" is his best-known work, and one of the very
best operaa ever written. It ia tuneful and dramatic.
and in fact is of a style which might be advantageously
emulated by some of his auccessors.
<h4>127 Ave Maria</h4>
The first prelude of the Forty-eight Preludes
and Fugues of Bach is used as an accompaniment
to a wonderful melody to which Gounod
has set the Ave Maria. So wonderful is this
combination that mention of an Ave Maria is
generally taken to refer to this one. Indeed,
great as is the prelude, it is known to comparatively
few people in any other form than as the
accompaniment to Gounod's great melody. It
is known to most hearers as a soprano solo with
violin obligato and piano accompaniment.
This roll will be found to bring out the beauties
of the imitation of the voice part by the
violin in most satisfactory manner. 
<h4>156 Serenade-Sing, Smile, Slumber</h4>
A tenor solo, originally, this charming song has
been arranged for all sorts of combinations of
instruments. It is a musical setting to a poem
by Victor Hugo, which follows:
<p>
When thou singest while nestling at eve close by my side,<br>
Dost thou know what my soul unto thine would fain confide?<br>
Thy sweet voice wakes the mem'ry of days render'd joyful by thee.<br>
Ah! then sing, ah, sing, my fair one, then sing, still sing to me.
<h4>214 "Sanctus" from St. Cecilia Mass</h4>
This lovely number is from one of the many
religious works which came from Gounod's pen
in the latter years of his life. After having
for many years written almost nothing but
opera, in which he was very successful, his whole
trend of thought seems to have been changed,
and the dramatic instinct, which he had worked
long to develop, became subordinate to the religious
fervor which characterizes almost all his
compositions for the twelve years preceding
his death.
<p>
This Sanctus is a tenor solo with chorus, and
is delightfully effective on the organ. 
<h4>230 Nazareth</h4>
Nazareth is one of the songs which could have
been written by no one of a less refined nature
than Gounod-not to say, of a less religious
nature. One familiar with his work could almost
identify any of his sacred songs by the
unmistakable religious fervor which permeates
their whole structure.
<h4>293 Marche Romaine</h4>
This is a fine example of march rhythm of the
kind which makes one's foot keep time. It is
both pompous and dignified and never anything
but musical.
<h4>305 Funeral March if a Marionette</h4>
At the commencement of this composition, it is
supposed that two of the doll actors have had
a fight, in which one of them has been killed.
The others sorrowfully mourn the fate of their
companion and organize a party of pall-bearers,
who shall carry their friend to the cemetery.
The procession sets forth and on the road the
troupe converses about the vicissitudes of life 
and reflects sadly that it required but one hard
blow on the nose to knock the breath out of so
talented an artist. As the weather is exceedingly
hot, some of the troupe begin to find the
way long and tiresome and they stop at a wayside
tavern. They remark to each other that it
is not the duty of the living to die for the dead,
and in order to enable them to bear up, they
must partake of soothing and refreshing fluid.
Meanwhile they get into a discussion as to the
merits of their late companion and in the heat
of discussion, they forget that the funeral procession
has now reached the gates of the cemetery.
They finally decide to join, avoiding all
appearance of undignified haste. They fall
into their places and enter the cemetery to the
same phrase as the one at the beginning of the
march.
<h4>355 Selections from Faust</h4>
To many people Faust is the only music by
which Gounod is known, and while these people
have missed much that is good, it may be said,
perhaps without successful contradiction, that
they are familiar with the best of Gounod's
compositions. Indeed, they are familiar with
some of the finest music ever written. The  
present roll includes the Introduction or Overture;
the apparition of Marguerite at the spinning
wheel; the Kennesse; Siebel's Song;
"Gentle Flowers"; the "King of Thule"; the
Jewel Song; Soldiers' Chorus, etc., embracing
nearly all the popular and best-known numbers
in the work.
<p>
Faust is one of the operas which never grows
old, and this roll is a source of delight to all who
hear it.
<h3>GRIEG, Edvard Hagerup 1843-1901</h3>
Grieg's talent was early fostered by his mother, who
was a talented amateur, and from her he got his first
lessons. He began to compose at nine, and on the
advice of Ole Bull was sent to Leipsic in 1858, where
he remained until 1862 under Hauptmann, Richter,
Reitz, Reinecke, Wenzel and Moscheles. His natural
ability, which was very great, could not help but
develop under the guidance of such an array of teachers.
On his return to Norway, the national instinct asserted
itself and the rest of his life was practically devoted
to the fostering of a Norwegian school of music. He
has left many works which must endure, including
nearly all the accepted forms.
<h4>181 Morning Mood-Peer Gynt Suite</h4>
The attention given this suite by concert orchestras
would lead to a conclusion which is
very generally accepted-that it was originally
written for orchestra. Such, however, is not
the case, for the incidental music to the Ibsen
play first appeared in the form of a pianoforte
duet. Certain numbers of it were selected by
Grieg and turned into two suites for orchestra.
The suites are known as Peer Gynt No.1, and
Peer Gynt No.2. It is from Suite No. 1 that
this roll is taken, and the organ will be found to  
produce this music in all its loveliness. It is
intended to musically represent daybreak on an
Egyptian desert. The climax of ever increasing
tone may be supposed to indicate the
increasing daylight.
<h4>183 Anitra's Dance-Peer Gynt Suite</h4>
One does not need to be told that this is an
Oriental dance. It breathes the Orient in every
measure. With this graceful, sinuous dance,
Anitra fascinates Peer Gynt, after first having
made a slave of him by her charms, and they
agree to fiy to the desert together.
<h4>184 Death of Ase-Peer Gynt Suite</h4>
The remarkable harmonies in this number are
inexpressibly charming and weird. It is a
funeral march somewhat different from the
accepted form, as it lacks the middle part or
trio. No combination of instruments could
possibly render this number more effectively
than the organ. One might think it was
written for the organ. 
<h4>182 In the Hall of the Mountain King-Peer Gynt Suite</h4>
Peer Gynt forsakes his stolen bride and wanders
about the mountains, straying into the hans
of the Mountain King where the gnomes tease
and torment him until he is driven out. The
opening of this number is quaint, mysterious
and subdued. It increases in both tempo and
power from the very first measure until at the
end it becomes a surging riot of sound. 
<h3>GUILMANT, Felix Alexandre 1837-1911</h3>
This aon of a Boulogne organist displayed his ability
so early in life that at sixteen he held an important
engagement. In 1871 he moved to Paris to take the
appointment as organist in Trinite, a position which
he held until 1901. As a composer he is known almost
solely by his organ works, of which there are many,
includitng a symphony for organ and orchestra, seven
sonatas and numerous concertos.
<h4>186 Offertory on Two Christmas 
Hymns</h4>

This composition proves Guilmant no less
capable as an arranger than as a composer.
These two old hymn tunes have lost none of
their original charm as a result of their treatment
in this manner. Guilmant's painstaking
workmanship is well exemplified in this number,
and being a composition for the organ, it is an
especially charming roll.
<h4>233 March Funebre et Chant Seraphique-No. 17</h4>
This is one of the best-known organ compositions
by one of the very great organists of the
world. Guilmant played it many times in this
country and gained for it the popularity it 
justly deserves. It is peculiarly organ music
and of the type which permits the organ to proclaim
itself the king of instruments.
<h4>262 Elevation, in Ab</h4>
This impressive composition designed to accompany
the ceremony of the elevation of the
Host, is one of this famous organist-composer's
best-known works. He has chosen that the uplifting
character of the music be displayed by
a fervid theme. He has designed the work that
it be rather free from complexities, both of
structural as well as of harmonic nature. This
beautiful melody makes its greatest appeal
simply, betraying at every measure the sincere
depth of religious thought in the mind of the
composer when it was conceived. This number
is very effective on the organ.
<h4>285 Pastorale</h4>
This form is one which is not unusual in Guilmant's
compositions, and one in which he
showed particular skill. The present Pastorale
was written for harmonium and piano and its
successful performance from a roll entails very
exacting conditions. We must have the sustained
harmonies of the harmonium, and the
broken chords of the piano, and it is surprising
to observe how satisfactorily the organ fulfills
all the requirements. This roll leaves nothing
to be desired.
<h4>288 Grand Chorus in D-Op. 18, No.1</h4>
This roll will bring to many a vivid recollection
of the composer's own playing of this great
composition. Guilmant was small in stature,
but he could conceive big things, and no better
testimony is needed than a hearing of this roll.
The first theme is given out in massive chords
which are tremendously assertive, giving way
later to a playful mood, which furnishes a wonderful
contrast, and prepares one for a reiteration of
the first part which is no less interesting
as a finale than as an opening theme.
<h4>304 Finale (Grand Chorus in 
Eb)</h4> 

Guilmant's conception of a Grand Chorus is
well indicated in this example of the composer
at his best. It is magnificently imposing and 
shows the composer to be the great workman
that he was. The thematic material is good
enough, but it is largely what he has done with
it that makes it the glorious composition it is.
It was, of course, written for the organ, which
means that the roll does it full justice.
<h4>296 Torchlight March-Op. 59, No.1</h4>
This is an unusual type of march, which begins
so pompously that it would seem impossible to
get down to the sentimental theme of the trio.
The contrast is not so great, however, as to
be inappropriate, or unenjoyable. The first
theme recurs after the trio, for a brief moment,
when a new theme is announced. Then as a
finale we find the first theme much elaborated,
and a brilliant coda. 
<h3>HANDEL, George Frederick 1685-1759</h3>
Handel was born in Halle, Lower Saxony, and was
contemporaneous with Bach, both having been born
in the same year. Nothing short of a volume could
contain the merest mention of the incidents in Handel's
life, to say nothing of a description of the influence
and beauty of his works. As a prolific and rapid
composer he had no equal. He wrote "Rinaldo" in
fourteen days, and that gigantic masterpiece, "The
Messiah," in twenty-four days. He is said to have
improvised on paper. He spent many years in England,
and wrote many of his greatest works in that
country. Indeed, there has lately arisen a controversy
between England and Germany as to whether
he was an English or German musician, Germany laying
claim to his birth, and England to his works.
<h4>182 Hallelujah Chorus</h4>
This marvelous chorus is known to everyone.
No other chorus approaches it in stupendous
conception, and it is generally conceded to be
the greatest of all choruses. Handel is said to
have remarked that when he wrote it "he
thought he saw Heaven opened and the great
God himself."
<h4>188 Largo from "Xerxes"</h4>
This dignified number is one of a more or less
lengthy list of pieces without which no catalogue
would be complete. Few are the people who
have not heard it in almost every possible form
except the original. It appears in the opera
"Xerxes" as an aria, but is played as a solo by
every sort of instrument from a trombone to a
violin. In no form, however, does it display its
grandeur to as good advantage as on the organ.
The dignity and delicacy of the organ are particularly
adapted to the happy rendition of this
the only number of the opera now heard.
<h3>HARKER</h3>
<h4>252 In the Twilight</h4>
This is a lovely little organ piece, and is one of
many equally pretty numbers by the same composer.
<h3>HAYDN, Franz Joseph 1732-1809</h3>
The career of Franz Joseph Haydn was not unique
in that he began life as a "poor devil"-to use his own
phrase-and ended it in affluence. We have grown
almost to assume that a very great man could begin
life in no other way. Indeed this is the measure of
true greatness.
<p>
Haydn's birth was exceptionally timely; Bach and
Handel were waning, and but for Haydn there would
have been no one to continue their wonderful work
until the advent of Mozart. He bridged the gap
between Bach and Handel, who were contemporaries,
and Mozart. It is doubtful, too, that we should have
had the Mozart we know, but for Haydn.
<p>
John Mathias Frankh, a schoolmaster and relative
of the Haydn family, on recognizing young Haydn's
talent, prevailed upon his parents to allow him to
take the boy with him to Hainburg that he might
educate him and teach him music. His mother gave
her consent reluctantly, as she had hoped her boy
might study for the priesthood. At eight years of
age he had learned all the music his benefactor was
able to teach him, and went to Vienna to sing in St.
Stephen's Cathedral, where he was taught Latin, reading,
writing, arithmetic and music, and given his
board, lodging and clothes for his services. After
some years his voice began to break, and the choirmaster,
wanting an excuse to dismiss him, seized with
avidity upon the opportunity furnished by Joseph
himself when he cut off the pigtail of a fellow chorister
with a pair of scissors. He was soundly flogged
and dismissed.
<p>
In 1753 Haydn became accompanist for Porpora, a
famous singing teacher, and from this time until his 
death opportunity smiled upon him. He was engaged
by Count Morzin to conduct his private orchestra.
Here he wrote the first of his one hundred and twentyfive
symphonies, and various other concerted works.
Prince Esterhazy engaged him when it became necessary
for Count Morzin to disband his orchestra,
and he remained in Esterhtizy's employ for thirty
years, during which time he composed most of his
quartettes and symphonies.
<p>
We are indebted to Haydn for many of the musical
forms in general use to-day. The sontata, the
symphony, and the quartette as we know them to-day,
are essentially as he left them. They have all been
elaborated, but in none of them has the form undergone
any change of a radical nature.
<h4>227 With Verdure Clad-"Creation"</h4>
The work in which this aria occurs was begun
in 1796 when Haydn was sixty-four, and finished
in 1798. The work in its entirety is one
of the most stupendous compositions for voices
and orchestra extant.
<p>
The present aria is of florid style and will
always be a favorite with lovers of oratorio. It
is for soprano voice and well displays Haydn's
ability to write in the florid style peculiar to
this voice.
<h4>316 "The Heavens are Telling" ("Creation")</h4>
The first performance of the "Creation," from
which this wonderful chorus is taken, was given
in private at the Schwarzenberg Palace on
April 29, 1798, and in public on March 19,
1799, at the National Theatre, Vienna. If
ever a work was inspired it was surely this stupendous
oratorio. Haydn said : "Never was
I so pious as when composing the Creation." 
<h3>HENSELT, Adolf von</h3>
Adolf von Henselt was born in Bavaria in 1814. He
was a celebrated pianist and was well known as a composer
of some very interesting studies for the piano.
He was Official Court Pianist to the Empress of Russia
and was Instructor in Music to the Princes. He
died in 1889.
<h4>307 If I Were a Bird</h4>
This melodious study was named by the author,
"If I were a bird, to thee I would fly," and
throughout the entire composition there is indicated
the spirit of unrest. The composition
indicates clearly the sentiment of longing and
at one point rises to an impressive climax. After
a pause, composure is regained and a flitting
melody is again heard, but this time the impatience
is subdued. Nothing is lacking to make
this a pleasing number. 
<h3>HERBERT, Victor 1859-</h3>
We, in America, have come to feel that Victor Herbert
belongs to us, so great have been his musical activities
among us. He was born in Dublin, Ireland. His
father dying when he was seven years old, his mother,
a daughter of Samuel Lover, the novelist, went to
Stuttgart to live. Here Herbert entered the Conservatory
and chose the violoncello as his instrument.
He came to New York in 1886 and became associated
with Anton Seidl as solo cellist and assistant conductor.
He has written much in the way of light
operas, and short pieces for various instruments, as
well as a number of more serious works.
<h4>267 Badinage</h4>
This is a playful conceit of a kind that no one
writes better than Herbert. The tempo rubato
is characteristic, and it fairly sparkles with
dainty melody and somewhat startling harmonies.
It is altogether a charming number
on the organ. 
<h3>HEROLD, Louis Joseph Ferdinand</h3>
The musical talent of this son of an able pianist soon
became apparent, to the delight of his father, who
entered him at the Conservatoire at Paris, the city in
which he was born. Here he soon won the first prize
for piano playing, and in 1812 won the "Grand Prix
de Rome" for a cantata. He composed in many forms,
but the stage furnished greater opportunity for a
man gifted as he was with an ability to express emotion,
and his known works are almost all in dramatic
form. About twenty operas, an enormous number of
piano pieces, a symphony, three string quartettes, and
a number of other works were left by him. Of all this
list, scarcely anything is known in America but the
opera "Zampa."
<h4>346 Overture to Zampa</h4>
This immensely popular overture is about all
that is known in America of this composer's
work. It is delightfully rich in thematic material,
and the workmanship shows the hand of
a master. It is regrettable this composer's
name and fame should rest on this single effort,
for he doubtless wrote much besides this which
is worthy of a hearing. 
<h3>HORSMAN, Edward I., Jr. 1873-</h3>
Was born in New York, March 10, 1873. Musically
he is chiefly self-taught, although he had instruction
from various teachers, principal among which was
his course of counterpoint under S. Austen Pearce.
As an organist, he has held positions at Old St.
Anne's and at St. Luke's, Brooklyn, also St. Andrew's,
New York.
<h4>250 The Curfew</h4>
This is a composition for the organ which was
built upon a theme originally intended for a
song setting to the first verse of Gray's
"Elegy." It is difficult to say whether or not
we have been deprived of any pleasure by the
change of heart on the part of the composer.
The one certain thing is that this American has
given us a charming number, and one which
improves upon acquaintance. 
<h3>HUMPERDINCK, Engelbert 1854-</h3>
Hwmperdinck was born at Siegburg in the Rhine
provinces, September 1, 1854. He displayed a talent
for music early in life, but was the recipient of no
really capable instruction until he was eighteen years
old, at which tilme he entered the Conservatorium at
Cologne, where he studied with Ferdinand Hiller.
While there he wrote a String Quartette which won
for him the Frankfurt Mozart Stipendium, which enabled
him to go to Munich, where he studied with
Lachner and later with Rheinberger at the Royal
Music School. He next won the Mendelssohn Stiftung
of Berlin. He went to Italy and met Wagner at
Naples. Wagner invited him to go to Bayreuth.
Here he became Wagner's valuable assistant in the
production of "Parsifal." Once more, however, his
talent and industry won him a prize, this time the
Meyerbeer prize of Berlin, and once more he started
south. He traveled through Italy, France and Spain,
remaining two years in the latter country, teaching
theory in the Conservatoire at Barcelona. Returning
to Cologne he was professor at the Hoch Conservatorium
from 1890 till 1896.
<p>
All this time he had been busy with his pen, and had
written a great deal of very beautiful music. His
best-known work, an opera, "Hansel und Gretel," for
which his sister wrote the libretto, was produced at
Weimar in 1893 with tremendous success. It is now
one of the standard operas, and is deserving of the
high regard it enjoys. Humperdinck was a rare
master of the techniq,ue of composition~ and while
never short of original thematic matter, was particularly
fond of folk tunes, many of which he used. 
<h4>337 Hansel and Gretel-Vorspiel</h4>
This is one of the loveliest of overtures. The
story is of course based on one of Grimm's
Fairy Tales, and nothing could be more beautifuI
than the music or the story which suggested
it. While the form is more or less free, it betrays
unmistakably the wonderful technique of
the composer. It is interesting to note the way
the first theme is used as an accompanimental
figure in the latter part of the overture. In
fact the development of the thematic material
is nothing short of marvelous. All that can
result from fine material and exquisite workmanship
is found here, and such proximity to
absolute perfection has seldom been attained.
<h4>339 "Evening Prayer and Dance of Angels"</h4>
In this number the composer has used as a first
part or prayer, the first theme of the Vorspiel.
and surely nothing of a more devotional nature
could have been chosen for the purpose. This
theme reappears here in all its loveliness, and
loses nothing of its charm by being linked to the
Angels' Dance. 
<h3>JACOBS-BOND, Carrie</h3>
<h4>289 A Perfect Day</h4>
A very popular and melodious song by a wellknown
song writer of the present day. The
composer's gift of melody is well displayed in
this song. 
<h3>JOYCE, Archibald</h3>
<h4>852 Vision of Salome Waltz from the Ziegfeld Follies of 1910</h4>
This is a very catchy waltz which became popular
immediately upon its presentation in the
Follies of 1910, and has retained its popularity
to an extent seldom enjoyed by music of this
kind. It still possesses all its charm, and will
be found a very satisfactory roll either for dance
purposes or as a musical number. 
<h3>JENSEN, Adolf 1837-1879</h3>
Jensen is known best as a song writer of the German
school. His songs, while original, might have been
written by anyone of several composers contemporaneous
with him. He has written numerous short
piano pieces, and several suites of pieces for piano
and for voices. An unfinished opera was found after
his death.
<h4>137 Murmuring Zephyrs</h4>
A transcription of one of Jensen's most beautiful
songs, and a good example of his ability in
this form of writing. The melody is beautifully
brought out in this roll, and it will be found a
charming number for the organ.
<h4>199 Wedding Music, Op. 45. Bridal Song No.2</h4>
All of the numbers of the set betray the lyric
quality which is so characteristic of the composer's
songs. The "Bridal Song" is perhaps
the best known of the set, and is very effective
on the organ as arranged in this roll. 
<h4>200 Wedding Music, Op. 45. Round Dance No.3</h4>
The round dance is the light number of this set,
and shows Jensen in a frivolous mood not uncommon
to him. It is effective on the organ, as
are the other three of the set.
<h4>201 Wedding Music, Op. 45. March No.1</h4>
This is one of four numbers originally written
for pianoforte duet under the general title of
"Hochzeitsmusik." This is a noble composition
of a stately and dignified character. It
will never supplant Mendelssohn's Wedding
March, which fact, by the way, is nothing to
its discredit, as many other wedding marches
have been written, some perhaps as good musically
as Mendelssohn's, but none seems to have
struck the popular fancy to the same degree.
This march suffers little by comparison, except
when considered as a wedding march. 
<h4>202 Wedding Music, Op. 45 
Nocturne No 4</h4>

This nocturne is quite different in character
from most compositions bearing the same title.
It will be found highly interesting if played in
the proper tempo. It is more often played too
slow than too fast. A safe rule might be to
play it as fast as possible and yet preserve its
inherent dignity. A few playing trials will
reveal the proper tempo, and the result will be
altogether charming.
