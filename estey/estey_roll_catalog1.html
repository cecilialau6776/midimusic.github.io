<h3>1.0 THE ESTEY RESIDENCE ORGAN</h3>

Of all the musical instruments produced by man the three most distinguished are the violin,
 the piano and the pipe organ. Of these the violin still remains the instrument of the virtuoso.
 No method of playing it has yet been invented except by the slow and tedious process of
 acquiring technique. It is the instrument of the accomplished musician.
<p>
 But self-playing
 devices have been applied successfully to both the piano and the organ-but with this difference.
 Piano music derives some of its quality from the personality of the player. The touch of human
 fingers has never been exactly reproduced by mechanical devices. In some compositions the piano
 player equals the pianist, but not in all.
<p>
 The pipe organ, on the contrary, is made for automatic
 playing. There is nothing the organist can do with his hands or his feet that cannot be duplicated
 by machinery. When an organ manual is touched the resulting tone is the same, whether the touch be
 hard or soft, slow or quick. The tone continues in the same volume until the key is released.
 Brilliancy, variety and other differentqualities are obtained by other sets of pipes, and these 
 pipes are brought into play by the stops. These stops can be brought on at the proper place by
 mechanical power just as effectively as by human fingers. If the organ music is correctly cut in
 the music roll, with all the stops, couplers and swells operated at their proper places, the most
 delicate ear cannot distinguish between the human organist and the mechanical organist.
<p>
 Moreover,
 there is a quite general belief among musical people that the organ is the greatest musical
 instrument. It embraces all the instruments of the
 orchestra-even the violin and the piano. It approximates the human voice with wonderful
 fidelity. It has qualities which no other instrument has; tones which no other instrument
 produces.
<p>
 Realizing all these things, we set about making this great instrument furnish the
 music of the home. We have been organ builders for several generations. We knew the qualities
 of the organ. We knew its history. It has been installed in homes, great baronial halls, palaces,
 castles in the past. But then it required the services of a resident organist. Nor was it in
 those days so great an instrument as it is today. Bach wrote organ music which could not be
 played upon the organ as he knew it. But he also knew the organ would develop. It has.
 Not only did it develop musically as Bach dreamed. It attained possibilities Bach never dreamed.
 By means of the self-playing device anyone may now play upon the pipe organ Bach's most difficult
 composition.
<p>
 That is why we commenced to build the Estey Residence Organ. In a country like this,
 with its rapidly increasing wealth, its new homes of an almost palatial character being built daily,
 the necessary cost of a pipe organ was negligible when weighed beside its possibilities. Features
 were being added to these homes whose only purpose was to heighten the pleasurable richness of
 living in them, that cost as much as the most complete pipe organ.
<p>
 Our belief has been justified.
 The Estey Residence Organ is more and more becoming a part of the furnishing of the well-appointed
 house. It gives to its proud owner the control of an orchestra-not the passive pleasure of listening
 to a paid professional organist, not the occasional performance of some musical guest, but his own
 instrument that he plays at will, with the satisfying consciousness that what he plays could not be
 excelled by either the paid organist or the obliging guest.
<p>
 This pleasure never palls. The cost of
 the Estey Residence Organ is forgotten while the satisfaction it gives endures. It is in a business
 sense a sound investment. The pipe organ improves with age, and the upkeep is nominal. It becomes a
 permanent part of the home. It will last as long as the house lasts, and it enhances the value of the
 house. In the hands of a skillful architect or designer it becomes a beautiful addition to the music
 room, living room or hall.
<p>

<h3>2.0 MUSIC FOR THE ESTEY ORGAN</h3>

The music listed in this catalogue has been especially arranged with the greatest care for the Estey
 Residence Organ. It cannot be used on any other instrument. The music and the organ are worked out
 together and to fit each other. A corps of competent musicians is constantly at work producing music
 for the Estey Residence Organ and frequent bulletins are issued describing new compositions. From time
 to time additional volumes will be added to this catalogue, with the compositions classified and
 arranged in a convenient manner for easy reference.
<p>
 The compositions are catalogued alphabetically under two headings-by composers and by titles. The
 composers are also arranged in alphabetical order in the body of the catalogue. It has not been thought
 necessary to further classify under character of composition, such as opera, oratorio, especially
 since many compositions fall in more than one class.
 <p>
 The musical library of the Estey Residence Organ will continue to grow, guided partly by the tastes of
 the owners of the organs, and partly by our desire to present an adequate representation of the great
 and wonderful music available for the purpose. When a piece of music has been arranged for the Estey
 Organ at the request of any organ owner, that piece will be put into the bulletin, and subsequently
 into the catalogue, and will be available to any owner who cares for it.
<p>
 In selecting the compositions
 for arrangement, we have tried to cover a range that would meet the varying tastes of lovers of the
 organ, and our plan is to meet individual requirements as far as possible. We are ready to arrange
 any composition which a customer may desire, and this can be done with surprising promptness. We have
 kept in mind music especially suited to the home and such as would provide for almost any occasion, while
 at the same time furnishing a rather unusual opportunity for becoming familiar with the works of the
 greatest composers. Musical compositions can be studied with great thoroughness by the use of the Estey
 Organist, as the themes can be separated from the accompaniment and each studied separately.
 <p>

<h3>3.0 HOW TO PLAY THE ORGAN</h3>

There are three ways of playing every music roll. The first is with no effort on the part of the operator,
 beyond inserting the roll and starting the mechanism. In this way the perforations in the paper bring
 on and change the selection of stops and combinations at the proper places in the composition, and operate
 all the expression devices and the phrasing.
<p>
 With the second method the piece is pJayed with the proper
 stop combinations and expression devices operated by the perforations in the paper, while the operator
 introduces his own ideas of phrasing.
<p>
 A third way permits the operator to use his own selection of registration
 and gives him complete control over all the expression devices except the actual playing of the notes.
<p>
 None of these interferes with the playing of the organ by the hands and feet in the usual way.
<p>
 There is
 nothing intricate or mysterious about the mechanism. It is simply an application of wellproven mechanical
 principles for many years standard with all organ construction, but perfected and refined. A brief
 description of the action is given for information and guidance in order that the owner may clearly understand
 just what is done and why.
<p>
 Select the roll to be played, unfasten the cord, being sure that the paper is tightly
 rolled on the spool, and insert the pin in the left-hand end of the music roll in the spring receptacle at the
 top of the tracker box, letting the right-end pin engage in the slotted chuck at the opposite end of the
 tracker box. With the hand revolve the bottom or take-up roll until the hook in the center groove is in
 front, where the ring on the music can be easily attached. Revolve this roll, pulling off the paper from
 the spool so as to completely cover all of the holes or throats in the tracker bar, being sure that the
 paper is centered on the tracker bar. Then close the glass slide and press the &quot;on&quot; piston marked
 &quot;To Play.&quot; This permits a pressure of wind to enter the closed tracker box. Put the music in
 motion by moving the tempo pointer toward the right. As soon as the number noting the tempo of the
 composition is visible on the music roll, set the pointer on that number. When a perforation in the paper
 comes over a hole or throat in the tracker bar the wind fills this throat and tube leading from it and
 causes a small poppet at the back of the console to lift and complete an electric circuit. From then on,
 the action is that of the hand-and-foot played organ.
 <p>
 At the end of the selection a perforation registers with a throat which controls the reverse mechanism
 and the music roll is rewound. At the same time the wind is shut off from the tracker box and all stops
 and combinations which have been used are cancelled, all parts of the organ remaining at rest. When the
 rewinding is complete, the spool stops and may be removed and another inserted, in the same manner as
 before.
<p>
 When it is desired to operate the stops and ex&middot; pression devices by hand, the piston on
 the right of the tempo plate marked &quot;Stop Control&quot; should be in the &quot;off&quot; position.
 That is, the &quot;off&quot; piston should be down. It should be remembered that the stop controlled
 perforations in the paper are inoperative if this &quot;off&quot; piston is down. Inversely, when the
 paper is to control the registration and expression devices, the stop control piston &quot;on&quot; must
 be down.
<p>
 Never try to open the glass slide when wind pressure is in the tracker box. This wind pressure is
 controlled by the pistons marked &quot;To Play,&quot; &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off.&quot; It will be found
 that the &quot;off&quot; piston is automatically pushed down when the roll is being rewound and when the
 organ is at rest. Care should be taken to protect the tracker box from dust as far as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<h3>3.0 CATALOGUE OF MUSIC</h3>

<h3>BACH, Johann Sebastian 1685-1750</h3>
Leaving the name Bach out of the history of music,
there would be no history of music. This very
numerous family were prominent members of their
profession for a period of nearly two hundred years,
and so closely were they allied with the development
of musical art that the first sentence of this paragraph
becomes a truism. In all history there is not
so remarkable an example of heredity, or so strong a
refutation of the seemingly well-founded idea that
genius never repeats.
<p>
The real musical ancestor of the family was Hans
Bach, who was born about 1580 and died in 1626.
Hans had three sons deserving of mention as musicians.
One of these, Christoph, had three famous
sons, one of whom, Johann Ambrosius, was destined
to become the father of our subject, in whom the
spark of genius grew to a brilliance which is still
undimmed, nay which has grown brighter through the
years. His first lessons were given him by his father,
on the violin. At the age of ten both his parents died.
leaving him and his education in the care of his
brother, Johann Christoph, an organist at Ohrdruf.
The genius of the boy now displayed itself unmistakably,
and he progressed with a rapidity which was
not encouraged by his brother. The use of a valuable
volume of manuscript of Frohberger, Buxtchude and
other celebrated composers was forbidden to the boy,
who surreptitiously obtained it and copied it by moonlight,
spending six months at it. When the stern and
inhuman brother discovered what the youth had done,
he took away from him his hardly earned treasure.
<p>
Bach became a very great organist and was fortunate
in having his genius recognized and appreciated
during his life. His move to Leipzig in 1723 
was one of the most important events in his life, as it
gave him a position where his duties were not so exacting
that he could not devote the necessary time to
composition. He also found a musical atmosphere
which he had not known before. These ideal conditions
undoubtedly helped him produce the great works
of this period, which are among his greatest.
<p>
Many of Bach's contemporaries were skilled in the
art of polyphonic writing, and their work will stand
as exacting scrutiny from a standpoint of workmanship.
It is the musical test, however which places
Bach above all his predecessors and contemporaries.
Schumann referred to Bach as the man "to whom
music owes almost as great a debt as a religion does
to its founder." 

<h4>216 Toccata in F</h4>
Never was, nor will be, a greater toccata written
than this. To say it is the greatest of Bach's, is
the same as saying it is the greatest of all.
Words fail to describe it. It must be heard
not once or twice, but a dozen or twenty times
before its true greatness dawns upon one. It
is great musically, but marvelous structurally,
and worthy the study necessary to fathom its
depths.
 
<h4>270 Gavotte from Sixth English Suite</h4>
Tradition has it that the six English suites were
written for an English patron of Bach's and in
