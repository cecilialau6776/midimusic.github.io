<H3>2.7 CDs and CDROM Drives</H3>
<blockquote>
<h4>
Confusion about CDROM drives is enhanced further by the fact that
they are so similar in appearance and function to 5 1/4" floppy
disk drives and contain information stored on a commonly
recognized medium.
</h4>
</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
A lady bought a computer from us.  About a month later, she came in and
asked us to install a sound card which can support CDROM drives.  So we
installed a Soundblaster Pro for her.  A week later, she brings the
machine in and starts ragging us out because her CDROM drive isn't working,
and "It won't eject the disk."
<p>
I look at the computer.  "But you don't have a CDROM drive!" I exclaim.
She points at the 5 1/4" disk drive and says, "What kind of computer salesman
are you?  Can't even recognize a CDROM drive when you see one?"
<p>
It seems she had decided her 5 1/4" floppy drive was in fact a CDROM drive,
and since the CD fit in quite nicely, it <em>had</em> to be a CDROM drive.
<p>
Long and short of it:  the drive was destroyed, the CD was destroyed, and
all the technicians were laughing for a few hours.
<p><hr><p>
When working at the Blinn College computer lab I had a girl come up to the desk
and ask why her CDROM drive was not working.  I went to check it out and to my
surprise she had crammed the expensive software CD into the 5 1/4" drive.  I
had to take apart the drive to get the CD out, and of course it was ruined.
A week later, the same girl came in and did it again.
<p><hr><p>
We replaced a large number of very old PCs with the latest and
greatest.  This meant that new techonology was being
introduced to users who had previously used dumb terminals or 16mhz 386s.<p>
One user asked if he could use his CDROM to play music CDs.  I
said he could, but he would need speakers or headphones.  He
replied that he didn't have either, but in the mean time, he would
listen to the music coming out of the little hole (headphone jack).  I
nodded and left quickly.
<p><hr><p>
Recently, my CD drive stopped working. I concluded that somehow a 
driver had been lost or corrupted.  I emailed the company requesting a 
new driver.  A few days later the driver was mailed to me, on CD.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(kindly old grandmother type)</em> "I can't
 install your software. I tried to follow the instructions,
 but it just isn't working. Can you please help me, young man?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sure! Are you using the diskette or the CDROM
 version of our software?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "The CDROM version."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Are you using Windows 95 or Windows 3.1?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Windows 95."
</ul><p>
I walked her through the basic steps of inserting the CDROM
disk and getting to the 'Run' window.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Now type 'd:\setup' and then press the enter key."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It just gives me an error message, saying it can't find it."
</ul><p>
I tried several things.  I tried different drive letters.  I made sure the
colon was actually a colon and the backslash was really a backslash.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Let's remove the CD from the drive, and then I
 would like you to inspect the shiny side for visible scratches or
 smudges. If we clean them, you might be able to get the computer to
 read the setup file."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I've taken it out. Do I have to slide this little
 metal shutter out of the way to see which side is shiny?"
</ul><p>
AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!  <em>(bang head, thump, thump, thump)</em><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, let's just insert it back into the computer
 and try typing 'a:\setup'."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I recently helped my friend buy a new computer.  I set it up for him and
showed him all the basics.  Several days later, he called me.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "What's wrong with it?"
<li><b>My Friend</b>:  "My CD drive is screwed up!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "What exactly happened?"
<li><b>My Friend</b>:  "Well, remember you showed me how to load a CD?
 Before I turned on the computer, I took the CD out of the case and
 placed it on top of the computer right above the CD drive.  When I
 turned on the computer, the CD drive tried to read the CD!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "What??"
<li><b>My Friend</b>: "I know it was trying to read it because I saw the
 little light flashing, so I took the CD off the top
 of the computer, and the lights stopped!"
<li><b>Me</b>: <em>(stiffling laughter)</em> "I assure you, it wasn't...oh, never mind."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One night I asked a customer which drive was his CDROM drive. He told me it
was the one on top.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "How do I get the other side of the CD to play?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I work as a computer consultant at a certain university computing
site...so naturally, I was approached by a user on my day off at a site
where I don't work.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Student</b>: "I can't write to my disk!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Let me take a look."
<li><b>Student</b>: "See!  It won't let me write to the E: drive!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Um, that's a CD-ROM drive.  You can't--"
<li><b>Student</b>: "But I went out and bought these disks!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Um, you need a CD-R drive to use those, and--"
<li><b>Student</b>: "But this <em>is</em> a CD drive!"
</ul><p>
I explained that CD-ROM and CD-R drives use different types of lasers and
optics, that CD-Rs cost a lot more than CD-ROMs, and that very few
computers at this university have CD-Rs.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Student</b>: "So what if I plugged this into the 220-volt line over
 there and jumped up the laser's power and...."
</ul><p>
I suggested he use a ZIP disk for his mass storage needs and exited
post haste.
<p><hr><p>
As a service technician I have to deliver and set up many computers.  The
majority of my clients are teachers and schools.  While setting up
several systems for a school one day, one of the teachers asked me to come
and take her system back.  Curious, I asked why.  She replied back that
the CDROM drive was not working.  Well, knowing that the systems had no CDROM
installed, I asked her what had it done wrong.  She replied back that she
put a CD in, and she couldn't get it back out.  I walked back to her room,
and she quickly pointed to the face of the system between two blank bezels and
said, "I put it there in the CDROM drive, and it isn't working."  I explained
that the computer didn't have a CDROM drive because the school hadn't ordered
one.  Now furious with me, she ordered me to remove the system from her room.
I obeyed and went to the principle.  He told me to put it somewhere else where
it would be appreciated.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "What is this shiny record for?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "The shiny record?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, it came with the printer.  It won't fit in the slot."
<li> <b>Tech Support</b>:  "What slot?"
</ul><p>
Slowly it dawned on me that the shiny record was a CDROM disk, and the slot
was the 3 1/2" floppy drive.  She had no idea what a CD was or how to use it.

I need to kow how to disable D: write-protection. I want to delete a very
bad music CD I once bought. Contact me with info. at <em>[email address]</em>.

<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I just got this CD of Internet software in a gaming
 magazine.  How do I install it on my Sony PlayStation?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One of our clients ordered an Quadra 840AV, but they did not want
the internal CD which comes standard in that box.  No problem, I
took the CD out before I delivered it to the customer.  However I
did not have the blank bezel with which to cover the opening.  I
set the system up for them, gave them a quick lesson on its ins
and outs, and told him I would be back in a couple of days to
replace the bezel.
<p>
I returned two days later, opened up the case of the 840 to
install the new bezel and found about a dozen slips of used post-it
note papers.  Upon asking the operator about it I was told that she
had put them in there because she thought that the original CD
bezel, with it's long slim opening, looked like one of those trash
recepticles they have on the ATM machines.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(rather irate)</em>  "Your install CDROM doesn't work!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What error message are you receiving?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "It says, 'File not found'."
</ul><p>
I verified that he is typing the correct command to run the install program.
He is.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Double click on the 'My Computer' icon."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok, got it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Now double click on your CDROM drive icon."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok.  It says, 'File not found or device not ready'.
 Maybe I should just cancel my service since it's not working and
 go with another company!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sir...did you put the CDROM <em>in</em> the CDROM drive?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Um, no.  Do I have to do that?"
</ul>

A client phoned up complaining that her PC had frozen with the cursor in the
middle of the screen.  The keyboard seemed locked as well so we couldn't kill
the offending application. So I told her to switch off her computer and turn it
back on again.  After about twenty seconds she said it came back on and
it was still frozen.  I asked if she switched it off properly or if she just
switch off the monitor.  And she assured me that it was the computer she
switched off.  We did this again, just to be sure, and this time it only took
five seconds to turn back on, still frozen.  So I knew she was hit the monitor
button.  I asked the question again, and she got a little uptight, saying
there was only one button, and that's what she's pressed.
<p>
We discussed TV-like items on her desk, and I asked if there was something else
on or around her desk.  After the list of pens and pencils and other assorted
desk supplies, she mentioned her "CD holder."
<p>
On a hunch I asked if this "CD holder" was two feet tall and beige.  Sure
enough it was.  We switched it off and on, and it worked.  She honestly
thought the computer was just a place to keep her Windows CD.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Hello, is this Tech Support?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes, it is.  How may I help you?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am within my
 warranty period.  How do I go about getting that fixed?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, it's
 because I am.  Did you receive this as part of a promotional,
 at a trade show?  How did you get this cup holder? Does it have
 any trademark on it?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It came with my computer, I don't know anything about a
 promotion.  It just has '4X' on it."
</ul>
At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because he couldn't
stand it.  The caller had been using the load drawer of the CDROM drive
as a cup holder and snapped it off the drive.
<p><hr><p>
I once had a customer who had been trying to put his CD in his computer.
He didn't have a CDROM drive so, naturally, the task was difficult.  He
could not figure it out, and finally ended up opening his system to try to
put it in a card slot.
<p>
I spent ten minutes explaining what his disk drive was and that he did not,
in fact, have a CDROM drive.  I sent a disk to him and explained how it goes
in the system.  When I was finished, I went in to the bathroom and laughed
for about five minutes straight.  Hysterical, uncontrollable laughter.
