<blockquote><h4>
Once in a great while, tech support gets back at the inane
callers.

<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "How fast will my COM ports go?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "How hard can you throw your computer?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Can I ask you a really stupid question?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes.  And history will bear me out on that."
</ul>
Needless to say, that user was also a friend.  I have always wanted to say
this to someone, and there he was!

Our service does not work with a UART older than the 16550 one.  One customer
had an older UART chip, and he refused to believe it would keep him from
using our service.  He got very upset, finally snapping:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "What does UART stand for anyway??"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "It stands for UART gettin' online!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "When I touch the sound card board at the back of my
 PC, I can feel electric current."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Then don't touch it."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Student</b>: "How do I make a paper longer?"
<li><b>Consultant</b>: "You write more."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hello, I have a problem.  My name is Bob Murton."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "I'm sorry, but I can't help you with that problem."
</ul><p>
I did call him back and helped him fix his problem.
He didn't complain about my response, but he did get members of 
the department asking for a while afterwards if he'd fixed his "other" 
problem.
<p><hr><p>
When working as a computer consultant in college, a co-worker and I were
playing around with the NETSEND command in Windows NT.  At one point he
accidentally sent a message to all the NTs in the lab that said, "Can you see
me?"  Shortly thereafter, a girl came to our station looking perturbed.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Girl</b>: "Um, my computer is talking to me.  It's asking if I can see it."
<li><b>Co-Worker</b>: "<em>Can</em> you see it?"
<li><b>Girl</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Co-Worker</b>: "Click OK."
</ul><p>
We laughed for a good fifteen minutes after that.
<p><hr><p>
In 1989 I worked as a repair tech for a company that made Amiga and Atari
modems and hard drives.  On one of the Atari computers I used for testing, I
added a screen saver that just made a blank screen. One of the female line
leads used this particular computer for auditing floppy disks and was
unaware that I had added the screen saver.  One day when she came over to
test a few disks, she asked if I would turn the computer on for her.  I told
her that it was already on and jokingly told her that there was a loose
connection somewhere in the computer, but if you bang on the table by the
computer it should fix it long enough for her test (when in reality, it was
just bumping the mouse and turning off the screen saver).  I even banged on
the table to show her.  She accepted this and continued to bang on the table
whenever she tested some disks, and each time I had to hold in the laugher. I
decided to see how long I could get her to believe this.  A couple of weeks
later she was training someone new to her crew and included the table
banging to "activate the loose connection" as part of the training.  This went
on for a month before I finally decided to tell her what was going on when
one day she banged on the table a good ten times trying to activate
a computer that was turned off. 
<p><hr><p>
I am a system administrator, but at times, when I'm feeling benevolent,
I assist technically challenged users.  I was speaking with one of the
network analysts while enjoying a cup of latte, when a woman from the
Health Services department frantically rushed over to us.  We told her
to call the help desk, which is what she is supposed to do first, and then
her problem would probably be assigned to one of us.  She couldn't wait,
though -- you know that scenario.  She needed to copy a document to a disk
immediately, but her disk drive was "broken."  She was
flailing her arms with the diskette in her hand saying, "I keep trying
to put the diskette in, but it won't go in.  The disk drive is broken!"
<p>
The analyst and I looked at each other, then followed her to
her computer.  We stood next to her as she repeated her story. At the
same time, she was unsuccessfully attempting to shove her diskette into
the drive...with the disk <em>upside down</em>.
<p>
I told her that there wasn't anything wrong with her drive.  I said her
computer was upside down.
<p><hr><p>
I just had a phone call from a high-level academic asking why his screen
was so white, bright, and blurry, and if there was any way he could
increase the amount of ink it used.
<p>
I directed him to his monitor's brightness and contrast controls.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Him</b>:  "Brightness and contrast controls?  What do they do?"
</ul><p>
As a friend of mine has just commented, "Funny.  There's a brightness
dial on the monitor, but the users don't get any smarter."
<p><hr><p>
My boss received complaint about me from one of those users that hates all
tech support personnel.  He said, quote:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't know what that idiot did, but my PC was
 LAN connected yesterday, and now it's not."
</ul><p>
I had not touched this person's PC for several months. I went to her
desk and discovered she had moved her desk to the other side of the cube.
She had disconnected the Cat 5 LAN cable because it was too short to reach
the new desk location.
<p>
She was not in the area, so I moved the desk back and hooked the PC to the LAN.
I left a note saying it would "only work on this side of the cube."
<p>
Being an "idiot," I doubt that I could have found any of the longer LAN cables
in the tub drawer at my desk.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Am I speaking with Mr. Brown?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(in a heavy Italian accent)</em> "Yesss, who eees this?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "This is technical support. I see you requested
 to speak to a Mac expert."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "And you are theees Mac expert?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Yes sir, I am.  I see here you're having trouble
 receiving e-mail--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, your *&amp;@$% company put me on the phone weeeth
a stupid woman who didn't know @#$% about Macs and she @#$^ up my compoooota."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok sir, calm down.  What specifically is the
 problem  you're having with email?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Cannot you read, stupid woman?  Eeeet should say in the teeeecket."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sir, if you do not cease using abusive langauge and
 profanity, I shall terminate this call immediately."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(mocking tone)</em> "Oooooooh, okay, threatening
 the customer are we now?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sir, I will repeat my question.  What specifically
 is the problem you are having with email?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, every time I go and try to get eeet, it ask me
 for a pazzword.  It never do that before."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Do you know your password?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Did you enter your password?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  <em>(head in hands)</em> "Sir, if it is prompting
 you for a password, you must enter one to receive your email."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "But but but, I never deeeed theees before, and it work FINE."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What email client are you using?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Don't use those big eendustry terms to scaaare me.
 What is meaning client?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What <em>program</em> do you use?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Netscape, I justa download it.  I hated that !@#$%@ Eudora."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok sir, I can help you configure Netscape
 so it won't always ask you for your password, but it <em>will</em>
 ask for it once."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "But I never enter a #$!@%-ing password before!"
</ul><p>
After much cajoling and gratuitous verbal abuse, he finally consented to
let me configure his program.  He downloaded his mail and then asked,
in a sneering tone:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "So you are the Mac expert, eh?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, I'm not certified by Apple or anything,
 but I do own a Mac, and I do fine on it."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok, what ees this Mac TCP DNR file, what does it dooo?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, the DNR stands for Domain Name Resolver."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Eeees that eeeeeeeet?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sir, if you want the specifics on that particular
 file, I suggest you contact Apple tech support."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Some @#$%-ing Mac experta you ar-a, you stupid woman!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sir, I must stress to you that being abusive to
 technical support can result in the loss of service."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yeah, right-a, som-a stupid woman is-a gonna cancel my account!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Consider yourself reported."  <em>(click)</em>
</ul><p>
After that, I received a gushing email from a fellow tech who did a check on
the guy a few weeks after the call.  By his name and encrypted password was
the word "cancelled."  Sweet.
<p><hr><p>
I work in a small computer store, not only as a tech, but also as a
salesperson.  A customer came to me with a question about whether a
piece of software would run on his computer.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Have you checked the minimum system requirements on the box?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "The what?  Look, I just bought a computer here four
 months ago. Just tell me whether it will work."
</ul><p>
Alarm bells go off in my head.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Well, what kind of system did you buy?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I dunno, it was a <em>[brand name]</em>."
<li><b>Me</b>: <em>(grasping at straws, losing the will to live)</em>
 "How fast is the system?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, it's Microsoft 98."
</ul><p>
Ten minutes later, after making no progress whatsoever, I decided to throw
together some random jargon and buzzwords to get rid of him.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Well sir, I hate to tell you this, but your BIOS would
 cause an DMA type 3 conflict on the processor cache, causing a
 complete system shut down.  I'm sorry, but you can't run this program."
</ul><p>
The customer, unhappy with our "poor service," rants, raves, and goes down the
street to another computer store.  I happen to have a friend there, so I
called him, warned him, and told him what to say.  Last I heard, the guy was
still trying to figure out how to stop a DMA type 3 conflict with the
processor cache.
<p><hr><p>
I work as a clerk in a computer store.  Once a guy came in needing RAM for his
486.  I told him he probably needed parity SIMMs.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Isn't non-parity faster?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Well, yeah, more or less."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "That's what I want."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Well, sir, that won't work in your machine."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, it will. My friend said it was faster and
 that it would work."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Sir, non-parity is for 120 Pentiums and better.
 I assure you, it will not work in your machine."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My friend says it will, and he's a computer genius."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Fine."
</ul><p>
I put the parity away and got him two 8 meg non parity. As he left, I got a
good one in.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "See you tomorrow. Hang on to your receipt."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I had just completed a test install of a LAN-based remote control tool,
when a VERY dependant secretary called my office.  She calls me way too
often to have me show her how to do very basic things.  Her boss, "Don,"
insisted that "Tess" did not need special training, only my occasional
assistance.  That day, Tess was frustrated while trying to learn how to
use the thesaurus feature in Word 97.  I recommended that she use the Help
Assistant to learn.  She was unaware of how the assistant worked; an
idea came to mind.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Go to 'Help' and choose 'Microsoft Word Help'."
<li><b>Her</b>: "Ok.  A little paper clip came up. Ha ha!"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Now, see the text box?  Keep your eye on it, and tell me what it says."
<li><b>Her</b>: "'Hi...Tess....  So you want...to learn about...the thesaurus...today?'"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Now say 'Yes.'  Don't type it."
<li><b>Her</b>: "'Yes.'"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Now what does it say?"
<li><b>Her</b>: "First...I must suggest you...read 'Word 97...for Dummies.'"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Ask where it is."
<li><b>Her</b>: "Where is it?" <em>(pause)</em> "It says it is in my cabinet above my desk."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Oh, good.  Always trust the Help Assistant.  You will be
 proficient very soon.  Now the assistant knows you are going to get
 smarter, so it will now want you to type your questions in that box."
<li><b>Her</b>:  "Hey Don, I can talk to my computer!"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Gotta go!" <em>(click)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm trying to install Word 4.0, and it won't let me!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Word 4.0!? Isn't that several years old?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yeah, I got it when I was a freshwoman and never installed it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, so what is the problem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It keeps asking for disk 5."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What happens when you insert disk 5?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "That's the problem! I don't have disk 5. I only have
 disks 1-4 and 6!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  <em>(stunned)</em> "Ah. Um. Well, you need disk 5
 to install the program."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No I don't!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Uh. Yes. You do. If you don't, the program can't
 install. You can come to the HAC lab and use our PC's. We have Word 6.0."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't have to do that! I need to install this
 program now! My paper was due this morning!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Look, you can't install the program without the
 fifth disk. It can't be done."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes you can. My friends told me if I'm missing only
 one disk, it will install. I'll just be missing some fonts."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "That might be true if you were missing the last
 disk. But you are missing a middle disk. Just come down to the lab
 and use our computers."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What, do you think I don't know anything about
 computers? I need to install this, you idiot! My paper was due hours ago!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "I'm sorry. It simply can not be done.  You are
 going to have to use another computer or program."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Don't treat me like an idiot! I know it can be done.
 You don't know anything you moron. Put someone who knows what they
 are talking about on the phone."
</ul><p>
I snapped. Keep in mind that (a) we don't really do tech support, so she
can't complain to anyone, and (b) even if she does, as one of the only
competent student employees, I can get away with a lot.  I laid into her
hard, called her some nasty names, and hung up the phone.  I'm so glad I
was able to do that.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't read my fonts anymore."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Pardon?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My fonts have all disappeared from the screen."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Really.  Uhhh...have you changed anything recently?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No. It happened this morning."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, I'll log a call and be there in a few minutes."
</ul>
I trudged down to her cubicle (she had gone out for coffee) and looked at her
Windows 3.11 workstation.  She had changed her background window color to
mauve, and her text color to mauve.  I switched her text color to black and
left a post-it note saying the problem was fixed.  Fifteen minutes later:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "The fonts are gone again."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Really?  Did you change anything?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, they had been black, but that was hard to read,
 so I tried changing the colors, and they disappeared again!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hold on, I'll be down."
</ul><p>
Again, she had gone for coffee while I was there (she drank a lot of coffee).
Now her background color was blue, and her text color was blue.
Sick of this, I selected "Windows Default" for the color scheme.  Then I
changed the permissions on her DESKTOP.INI file to read-only.  I left the
post-it note and went back to my game of solitaire.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Hi!  My colors won't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, last time I was down I discovered an error in
 your Windows setup which I then was able to link back to a small
 hardware bug in your CPU.  It seems that the ALU is interfering with
 your video accelerator."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What does all this mean?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You can't switch Windows colors from default
 anymore.  Nothing can be done.  Sorry."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, all right, thanks."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I once went on site to fix a problem a customer had.  Nothing would come up.
I asked if he cycled the power, and he said he did.  I asked him to show me
exactly what he had done.  He turned the monitor off and on again.
<p>
I reached down under the desk, hit the reset button, and everything was fine.
He asked what the problem was.  I said, "Don't worry about it sir, it's an
eye-dee-ten-tee error -- takes too long to explain -- have a nice day."
<p>
Write down 'I,' 'D', '10', and 'T' together, and you'll see what I meant.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I want to send an email. How do I do it from WordPerfect?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you have an email program?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Are you on a network?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you have a modem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Then you can't send email."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "This program is useless! How am I going to send an email!?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, if you push the send button a small door
 will open at the back of your monitor, and a pigeon will fly out with your message."
</ul><p>
I had the phone on mute when I said this last line, but my supervisor didn't
know it.  The look on his face was great.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "What's the fastest way to move 500 megabytes of data
 daily from Santa Cruz to Los Angeles?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Fed Ex."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I can't get loaded!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Try stronger drinks."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
The classic Freudian slip delivered to PC users whose mouse and modem
share the same interrupt request:
<ul>
<li> "The problem is an IQ conflict..."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I have a Mac friend that convinced the other IBM people at his
company that when the token ring network went down, it was due to
someone removing the cable and the token falling out.  He actually had
businessmen on the floor looking for it.  I think he eventually stated
he found it himself to avoid getting lynched.
<p><hr><p>
Some years ago, I was working for Apple's Customer Service line,
answering as many technical support calls as possible.  Since this
was before Apple offered "official" customer assistance, I often
answered technical questions with the standard company line, "Have
you called your Apple dealer yet?"
<p>
One day I received a call from an elderly woman, who wanted to pay
her local utility bill.  I told the woman that she had reached
Apple Computer, and that she had probably dialed the wrong number,
fully expecting that she would acknowledge her error and that this
would be the end of the call.
<p>
Much to my surprise, she countered, "Young man, don't tell me where
I've called.  I dial this number every week and you can't tell me
that I cannot pay my bill through this number!"  I was stunned.
I repeated my insistence to her that she had reached the wrong
number.  Still, she wouldn't budge.  She had dialed the right number,
and come hell or high water she was going to talk to someone who
could help her.
<p>
I was exasperated, but being the quick thinking employee that I am,
I replied, "My mistake ma'am, you are correct, you have dialed PG &amp; E.
If you just tell me the amount on your bill, I'll enter it into
our records here."  I made some keyboard noises in the background
trying to sound as official as possible.  "You're all set here,
Ma'am.  You can just mail your check into us."
<p>
There was a pause on her end.  Then, "Could you give me the billing
address so I can mail my check to you?"
<p>
Red alert!  "Uhhhh, Ma'am?  Our address should be right there on your bill."
<p>
"Oh yes, you're right."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Hello?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Cursor's broke."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Beg your pardon?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Cursor's broke on my VT220 computer."
</ul>
A VT220, of course, is the model number of a dumb terminal made by Digital.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Did you try plugging it in?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Of course I did. What do think I am, an idiot?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Sometimes on those VT220 'computers' you have to
 reverse the polarity on the plug.  Can you unplug it and turn
 the plug upside down and plug it back in?"
</ul>
The tech knows full well that the cord has a grounded three-pronged plug that
<em>cannot</em> be plugged in upside down.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, hold on."
</ul>
Pause.  <em>Beep!</em>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, I've reversed the polarity and it works fine now!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
An elderly lady bought a Mac Performa and when she got it home she
decieded to give me a call.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I opened my computer and set it up and I love it!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "I'm glad to hear it how can I help you?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, I turned it on and can't seem to get anything to happen."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Did you turn the power switch on?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Is the monitor on?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What do you see?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "The same thing I saw in your store."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What is the problem?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I can't get the arrow to move."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, what do you have plugged into the system?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, the thing with the letters on it and this foot pedal thing."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Is the foot pedal on a chair mat?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, you will need to get one before it will work."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Thank you, I'll do that."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Last night, I had a woman on the phone who was trying to get her Mac's DOS
card to see more memory.  Not only did she change her story ten times, but she
kept restarting the Mac, over and over.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Let's change this option in PC Setup now, ok?"
</ul>
<em>BONG!</em>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ma'am, why did you restart your Mac?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I wanted the changes to take effect."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Please don't restart until I ask you to, ok?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok."
</ul>
Anyway, we'd go back into the PC Setup, change something, and then,
inevitably, <em>BONG!</em>  I got so upset, I finally said to her, "Ma'am, you
shouldn't restart so much, you're going to burn out your restarting coil, and
that's not covered under Apple's warranty."  She got so scared, she didn't
even want to restart her Mac ever again.  She even told me, "Thank you so much
for telling me that, I don't want to burn out my coil."
<p><hr><p>
A support representative friend of mine came up to me one
day and said that he thought he had done something wrong.
He had been walking a novice Mac user through rebuilding her desktop.  She
tiresomely questioned every direction the technician made.  After half an hour
of patiently talking her through what should have been a one minute process,
she finally stated, "Oh!  Now it says, 'Are you sure you want to rebuild the
desktop on the disk XXX?'"<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh, now there's something like a spinning barber pole
 on the screen."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "You didn't press 'OK' did you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes.  You said 'OK'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  <em>(acting alarmed)</em>  "I just said 'Ok,' I
 didn't mean for you to <em>press</em> 'OK'!"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(panicking)</em>  "What should I do now?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Run!  Get out of there!  Run!  Run!"
</ul><p>
The next thing he heard was the phone hitting
the floor, the sound of rapidly retreating footsteps, and a door slam.
After numerous calls over the course of an hour, the customer finally
answered the phone. She had waited outside for an hour -- when the computer
didn't explode, she went back inside and unplugged it.

<li><b>Customer</b>: "I tried to use this web page from my bookmarks, but it
 comes back with a DNS failure!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Can you go anywhere else?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "YES!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Then it's probably that the web site is down for
 repairs or that it's been discontinued.  That happens on the Internet."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, go out and fix it! It's at [some obscure site in Japan]."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "That would require me to take Japanese language
 lessons for about six months. Then you will have to send me money and
 plane tickets to travel to Japan to speak with the people who
 shut down the web site."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Geez, all I want is naked pictures!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Who is your supervisor, so we can make arrangements?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ms. [such and such]."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, please hold, and we'll have a conference call..."

I work in the IS department of a healthcare company, and we are converting
all our sites from old LANtastic networks to Windows NT server and new
computers running Windows 95. A manager at one of the sites called me with
a problem.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Manager</b>:  "How come I can't log into this new server?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Well, although on the old system the server can double
 as a workstation, the new system no longer allows that.  You can't
 log into the server as a user.  You'll have to use one of the new
 Windows 95 machines."
<li><b>Manager</b>:  "What??  Look, I'm the site manager, and I should have
 the best computer.  I shouldn't have to use the same old machines as
 every other common employee."
</ul><p>
I put her on hold and called her site on my other line.  When I got the
receptionist, I asked, "What's your manager wearing today?"  She gave me
a full description.  I went back to the other line.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "You probably don't want to use the server anyway, because
 we can see you from it."
<li><b>Manager</b>:  "What?"
</ul><p>
I described exactly what she was wearing, right down to the fact that she'd
spilled coffee on her blouse earlier in the day. She hasn't called back since.

My friend was quite good with computers.  His brother was not.  His
brother's biggest problem was double clicking.  He could never seem to
do it fast enough and would often get very frustrated in his attempts.
One day, while his brother was away, my friend took a snapshot of his
brother's screen, set it as the wallpaper, and cleared the desktop of all
icons.  You can't even begin to imagine how frustrated his brother grew
trying and failing for hours to click on the "icons" in the wallpaper.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm sorry. I think I just deleted the Internet!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "That's ok. We have it backed up here on tape somewhere."
</ul>

This is a true account of personal trial, which happened while I was
working Tech Support for a company which sold Stock Analysis software.
The company would sell data to its customers who would download said
data from the company's database on a daily basis. Their listing of data
was, therefore, kept on their hard drive, along with the data itself.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Thank you for calling, how can I help you?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Yeah, I want my data back. You need my phone number?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Back? What's happened to your data?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "It's gone. I need it back. Let's get this going, hmmm?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ummm...sir, what happened to it?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Don't you worry about <em>that</em>. Just give me my freaking data."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Well, we have several options for data replacement. If you
 can send us a listing of the stocks you had--"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Send you a list? I don't have time for this !@*#$!&amp;. Give me my data."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Uh, unfortunately, it's not that easy. We can--"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Look, buddy, don't jerk me around. Just press your little
 whachamajiggers there, zip me down my data, and we're good, ok?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Well, sir, these are your options. You can--"
<li><b>Him</b>: "*$#&amp; you, you stupid &amp;#&amp;$!  Stick those options up your @#$*!
 Why won't you give me my data!?!?"
</ul><p>
For the next half hour, I try to explain amidst all the interruptions
that he is going to have to pay for the replacement data,
either by downloading it again or by getting it on disk from us, and that it
would be Monday at the earliest (this was Friday, one hour before closing)
before he got it back regardless of which method he chose.
This, of course, was unacceptable and resulted in me being subjected to
more tirades of ridiculous cursing and genetic analysis. Finally,
just to change the subject (he refused to hang up, which I was hoping
for), I inquired further into the whereabouts of his missing data.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Sir, what exactly was it that happened to your data?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "You have it there! What the hell is in your head?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "What happened to the data you used to have?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Well, this is a new computer, and I need it here, if you
 morons can handle that."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Oh! Well, we can transfer it from the old machine. Is it--"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Nope, nope, can't do that. It's dead."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Dead?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "That's right, dead. Your software killed it, so I threw it away."
<li><b>Me</b>: "You...threw it away? What was wrong with it?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "What are you, deaf?!? It wouldn't work any more, the
 monitor, laser printer, nothing, so I threw it all away."
<li><b>Me</b>: "You threw away the printer?!?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Yeah, damn thing cost me $8000 to replace it all, and I'm
 gonna sue you guys!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Well, um, what was wrong with it? Did it get hit by
 lightning or something?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "I told you, your software killed it! You got @#!+ in your
 ears? I put your $#^&amp;*# disk in, and the whole computer just died."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Died."
<li><b>Him</b>: "That's right, pooboy!! It wouldn't load anymore, not even
 windows, just a blank screen with some gobbledygook babble on it."
<li><b>Me</b>: "What babble was this? An error message?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "You're damn right, an error message, caused by <em>your</em>
 software!!! I hope you can clean toilets, buddy!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Do you have the error message written down somewhere?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Well, Mr. Smartypants, as a matter of fact I do! And I'm
 gonna use it in court to see you in rags!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "What's it say?"
 (rustle, rustle, curse curse, mutter)
<li><b>Him</b>: <em>(rustle, rustle, curse, curse, mutter)</em> "Ah hah! Here
 it is! It says, 'Non System Disk or Disk Error!' You'll pay for this!"
</ul><p>
At this point, I, and the other techs who were listening in by now,
shared a great laugh, which I didn't bother to mute.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Sir, you will be happy to know that you threw away a
 perfectly good $8000 set of machinery because you were stupid enough
 to leave a disk in the drive."
<li><b>Him</b>: <em>(long silence)</em> "...well, I'm still gonna sue you guys..."
<li><b>Me</b>: "I want front row seats in the courtroom. Have a nice evening."

Epilogue: When he called back on Monday, the manager terminated his
account for abusive behavior for that record two minutes, thirty-eight second
call.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Sir, something has burned within your power supply."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I bet that there is some command that I can put into
 the <em>AUTOEXEC.BAT</em> that will take care of this."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "There is nothing that software can do to help you
 with this problem."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I know that there is something that I can put in...some
 command...maybe it should go into the <em>CONFIG.SYS</em>."
</ul>
Minutes later:
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, I am not supposed to tell anyone this but there
 is a hidden command in some versions of DOS that you can use.
 I want you to edit your <em>AUTOEXEC.BAT</em> and add the last
 line as <b>C:\DOS\NOSMOKE</b> and reboot your computer."
</ul>
Pause.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It is still smoking."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "I guess you'll need to call Microsoft and ask them
 for a patch for the <em>NOSMOKE.EXE</em>."
</ul>
Four hours later, he calls back.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Hello sir, how is your computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I called Microsoft and they said that my power supply
 is incompatible with their NOSMOKE.EXE and that I need to get
 a new one.  I was wondering when I can have that done?"
