<blockquote><h4>
Stories of customers that just can't get the help they need.
</h4></blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Hi, I can't seem to connect you guys are you having a problem?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well sir, what dialup software are you using?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "The one you provided."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "And what version is it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(says the version number)</em>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Oh, that's the problem you need the latest version."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok, how do I get it?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, just transfer the file via FTP."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well that would be nice, but I can't connect to the Internet."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(sounding exasperated)</em> "I told you just to FTP the file sir."
</ul><p>
I hung up.
<p><hr><p>
This incident happened to me in India. This was in 1992-3 when Windows 3.1
was becoming popular. My machine had a CGA card and monitor, which I exchanged
for a VGA card and monitor.  The machine booted up -- there were no warning
beeps -- but nothing was appearing on the screen.  So I called up tech
support.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "The computer boots up without any warning beeps, but
 nothing shows up on the screen."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is the monitor connected."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, but there is no display."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did you install the drivers for the VGA card?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "How can I install them before I'm in DOS?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You have to install the drivers first before you
 can get a display."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "You don't need VGA drivers to boot to DOS like you do
 for Windows.  I should be able to boot to DOS."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, insert the floppy you received with your
 card. Go to the A:\Utilities directory. Type 'readme.com'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I cannot see anything. How do you expect me to read a
 file on the screen?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Read the file, and it will explain everything."
</ul><p>
I hung up.  The problem was that the monitor was broken.  I took it to the
shop and proved it, and they gave me a replacement.
<p><hr><p>
When I was in college, I needed to connect to the school's network from my
own computer in my dorm room.  I knew there was a dial-up number that
would allow me to log in and run limited commands.  All I needed to know was
the number.  So I called the help desk.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "I'm trying to access the University's network from my
 computer in my dorm room.  Can you help me?"
<li><b>Help Desk</b>: "Which lab are you in?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "I'm not in a lab. I'm in my room."
<li><b>Help Desk</b>: "Then you're not on the network."
<li><b>Me</b>: "But I want to connect over the phone line.  What number do
 I need to dial?"
<li><b>Help Desk</b>: "You need to call <em>[phone number of help desk]</em>."
<li><b>Me</b>: "No, that's your phone number.  I need a dial-up number for
 the computer."
<li><b>Help Desk</b>: "I don't understand.  What are you trying to do?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "I want to connect my computer to the school's network
 through the dial-up."
<li><b>Help Desk</b>: "Why don't you use a computer in the lab?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "That would defeat the purpose of having a computer in my room."
<li><b>Help Desk</b>: "Well, your computer is not connected to the school network."
<li><b>Me</b>: "I <em>know</em>!  I want to use my modem to connect."
<li><b>Help Desk</b>: "What's a modem?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Never mind."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
My company recently hired a new technician, and at first he seemed to
know what he was doing, but soon he got in over his head.
A customer brought in a system and said she couldn't get on the
Internet.  When the tech couldn't get the plug-n-play modem to work
under Win3.11, he assumed it was a new modem, and it couldn't be done. He
called her.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, this modem, since it is plug-n-play, will not
 work in Windows 3.11.  You'll have to get a new modem or install the
 Windows 95 upgrade."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "But I've been using that modem for over a year in
 Windows 3.11, and it never gave me any problems."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well it doesn't work now."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "If it worked before, why would it not work now?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Lightning must have hit it, and now it won't work
 in anything but Windows 95."
</ul><p>
She called back later and asked for someone else.
<p><hr><p>
A year ago, I was programming a database for one of the larger
insurance companies in my state.  The computers they had were awful
things that still ran Windows 3.1 and took about three minutes to boot up.
<p>
One morning I turned on my computer and waited for it to boot. Just as
it loaded Windows, it started rebooting all over again.  I waited again,
and it did it again.  After about ten times, I began to wonder.  I would have
just loaded DOS and found the problem, but one of the security systems on
the computers there automatically rebooted the computer if you went to a
DOS prompt.
<p>
So I called tech support and explained the problem.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok sir, have you tried rebooting the computer?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I have a Pentium 100 that I bought in March 1996.  I moved since then and
lost the documentation about the motherboard. I called tech support.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Hi, I have a Pentium 100, and I want to put in a faster
 processor, a 133 MHz.  I lost my motherboard documentation and the
 jumpers aren't marked.  Can you tell me what the maximum is for the board I have?"
</ul><p>
I give him all the information he needs, restating the question three
times in the process.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "I don't have that information."
<li><b>Me</b>: "You guys built the machine. Don't you have an engineer
 somewhere with this information?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Um, I don't know let me ask."
</ul><p>
Ten minutes later:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, I am going to transfer you to a technician."
<li><b>Technician</b>: "Ok, you want to put a 133 processor on this board?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Technician</b>: "This board only goes up to 100 MHz.  You can use it
 with Pentium 75, 90, or 100."
<li><b>Me</b>: "That's a disappointment -- I wish you hadn't sent me a
 machine with no upgrade flexibility like that."
<li><b>Technician</b>:  "Well, you can put the P133 in -- it will run at 133,
 even though when it boots it will only say 100."
<li><b>Me</b>: "REALLY?  In the five years I have been working with PC
 hardware and software, and of all the machines I have upgraded, I have
 never heard of this.  Are you sure you are correct?"
<li><b>Technician</b>: <em>(long pause)</em> "Um, no."
<li><b>Me</b>: "You just wanted to get me off the phone, right?  Well, I just
 wanted the answer about my board -- if the answer is no, fine, but
 don't lie to me."
<li><b>Technician</b>:  "Um, sorry.  No, you can't upgrade that board to a
 processor faster than 100."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Hi, I have a problem with my left speaker, no sound is  coming out of it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Have you adjusted the balance in the volume properties?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Yes, it's definitely not that, and it's not a sound card or
 connection problem either. Could you just send me some new speakers?
 It's still under warranty."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Errrm, ok, I want you to go to DOS and type
 'format c:' and then restore your hard disk from the master CD."
<li><b>Me</b>: <em>(click)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I called my cable modem service about a problem involving a series of constant
disconnections and lock ups.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Oh, you need to empty your browser's cache."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Well, that's a different program."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you use Internet Explorer or Netscape?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Internet Explorer."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, click on View/Properties/Internet Options."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "I'm sorry but cache files from an entirely different
 program couldn't possibly be causing this."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Hmm, let me refer you to advanced technical support."
</ul><p>
The advanced technician knew exactly what the problem was and solved it.
A month later it happened again.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "When was the last time you cleaned your browser's cache?"
</ul><p>
Yet again I was forwarded to advanced tech support, and my problem was solved.
A while later, it happened a third time.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Oh, it's the cable line in your area. We'll get a
 truck rolling on it right away."
<li><b>Me</b>: "If it's the cable line, how am I able to connect at all?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "There could be a short in one of the lines, and
 that could be causing it."
</ul><p>
The next day the cable repairman arrived and checked the lines in my area,
but my service was again working flawlessly even before he arrived.  When he
left, I turned on the TV and noticed the cable was out.
<p><hr><p>
I'm a system administrator for a fairly large company.  We were shipping
out new desktop PC's to all our branches, but the PC's did not come with
installed modems. I installed modems in these machines and configured
all the necessary software before I shipped them out.  I received a call
from one branch manager stating that his modem would not work.  I had
him try all the standard tests, and it appeared that the modem had
become unseated.
<p>
He called the IS director and asked why I hadn't tested the machine before
I sent it.  I tried to explain that I did, and the card had become unseated
in shipping.  The IS director, knowing that I install PCanywhere on all
machines so I can troubleshoot from my office, asked, "Can't we use PCanywhere
to dial in and fix that?"
<p><hr><p>
I had just come across a Compaq 386 Deskpro motherboard. Since I was
just getting into PCs, I thought it would be cool to wire it up for my
brother. But I had no idea what the pinout for the power supply plug
was, as it was non-standard. So I called up Compaq tech support.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "I just got an old 386 Deskpro motherboard, and I wondered
 if I could get a pinout for the power supply plug, so I can power it
 up and see if it works."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What happens when you turn it on?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ummm...nothing, I don't have a power supply for it. I need a
 pinout to wire up a standard power supply."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I see. Can you get into Windows?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
About two years ago I signed up with a local ISP.  They gave me some
software to install and said it would take up to five days for my account
to be activated.  I installed the software, but five days later I still
couldn't get on.  I waited two more days, then called to find out what the
problem was.  The tech support person said he would check on it and call me
back.  Four hours later, I still hadn't received a call, so I called again.
The same guy answered the phone.  I asked if he had figured anything out.
He replied that he had not.  I told him if he couldn't fix the problem, I
wanted to cancel my service.  He stammered and told me he really didn't
know that much about computers, but he didn't want to lose my business.
<p>
At this point I completely lost my patience and told him to cancel the
account immediately.  He told me that to cancel my account I had to send
them email from it.
<p><hr><p>
I called the TurboTax support number for help with the online filing of my
taxes.  Here is my dialog with the "tech support" person:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "How can I help?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "I'm having a timeout problem when filing online.  The
 modem dials up ok, but after connecting I get a timeout error."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What kind of modem do you have?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "A MultiTech 28.8."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(pause)</em> "We only support 9600 baud. What's 28.8?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Twenty-eight point eight K-baud."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What's K-baud?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
My husband and I helped our church get online. We installed a new
modem, checked everything out and then after doing some research
on local ISPs we chose a reputable one that would give the
church a good deal.
<p>
Netscape came with the modem's communications software, but it was an old
version.  After getting everything going we started to download Netscape's
upgrade.  The ISP kept hanging up ten minutes after starting the download.
We checked all the settings. Everything checked out fine, but we
were still experiencing the problem.  It would even disconnect while
downloading email.
<p>
I asked the church's secretary to call the ISP's tech support number the
following morning.  The next morning she called me back and reported that the
ISP tech support person had told her she needed to reformat her computer and
reinstall Windows.
<p>
I called the tech support person myself.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "I can't believe you told her that!  You told her that?
 That's preposperous! This is not a software problem, this is a problem with the ISP.
 What does this have to do with email downloads and getting disconnected?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Look, this is a common problem. I can't even
 download email without it disconnecting. It is like that with all
 ISPs. This is what we tell all our customers who have this
 problem. You see, SMTP stands for--"
<li><b>Me</b>: "I don't think you have any idea what you are talking
 about. I am with Netcom, and this has <em>never</em> happened to me."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I was getting several "illegal operation" errors on a new Windows 95 machine
I was trying out.  So I called tech support.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I want to buy this computer, but I'm a little
 concerned that I'm getting so many error messages. Is that common
 with this machine?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, we have to reformat the hard disk and
 reinstall the software every day. That's normal."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Wait, wait, wait. You're saying that I will have to
 reinstall Windows every single time I use the computer?!?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "When it has errors, ma'am, that's the only way to
 get rid of them."
</ul><p>
Needless to say, I purchased my computer elsewhere.
<p><hr><p>
I had a problem with my computer.  Out of the clear blue, the sound card
disappeared from my hardware settings.  After trying to get Windows 95 to
re-install it, I gave up -- Win95 consistently told me that the card was a
Soundblaster, and I knew it wasn't.  But I didn't know what kind it was, and
the manuals that came with the computer didn't say.  I called tech support,
and they asked me what had been installed on the system since I bought it.
"Microsoft Office, and Plus" I said.
<p>
They told me <em>that</em> was the problem.  They told me I wasn't
<em>ever</em> supposed to install anything on the machine except for what
came with it originally.  Then they told me to reformat my hard drive and
re-install everything from the setup CD.
<p>
I asked to speak with this guy's supervisor, and he told me the same thing.
<p><hr><p>
In the 1980s, I did not know what <em>fdisk</em> was or how to use it, so I
called tech support and left a message on their answering machine.  I spoke
very clearly and left the message:  "My hard drive crashed, and I've been
told that I need to do a low-level format before I can restore from my
tape backup.  How do I low-level format my hard drive?"
<p>
The next day, our receptionist handed me this message from the tech support
team:  "Put the floppy diskette in the drive and type <em>format a:</em> and
hit enter."
<p><hr><p>
I bought a laptop with a DVD drive and S-video output, thinking to use
it, among other things, to play DVDs on my TV.  The S-video output

worked fine until I tried to play DVDs, when it switched back to the
laptop's monitor.  So I called tech support.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "It's not supposed to work, because the
 resolution would degrade too much."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "But this is DVD; they're designed for TV sets."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "No.  You see, it looks really great on your
 computer monitor, but the TV doesn't have as good resolution."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "But DVDs aren't SUPPOSED to use all that resolution.
 They're <em>supposed</em> to be shown on TV sets.  Anyway, do you
 have a solution for me?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, if you'd get an HDTV, it would work fine!"
</ul><p>
As it turns out, he was right about one thing -- it wasn't supposed to
work.  Buried in the documentation of the MPEG decoder is a line that
the card didn't support interlaced displays.
<p><hr><p>
The company is now dead, so I can mention this one by name:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b> <em>(an elderly sounding woman)</em>:  "Hello,
 Commodore customer service.  May I help you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, I'm trying to find the file format for Deluxe
 Music Construction Set."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "You want to format a disk?  Lemme see..."
 <em>(paper rustles)</em>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No.  I'm looking for documentation on the file
 format for DMCS."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Oh, yes.  I've got documentation here."
 <em>(paper rustles)</em> "Ok, to format a disk, first you--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, no...I'm looking for the file format for--"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You want to format a file?  I umm..."
 <em>(paper rustles again)</em>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "NO... I DO NOT WANT TO FORMAT A FILE!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, well, to format a disk, you--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "NO!  I don't want to format a disk.  I'm a
 programmer.  I'm trying to find some documentation on--"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "We have documentation."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, I understand.  But I'm looking for specific
 documentation on software that I bought through Commodore.  I'm
 looking for documentation on the file format for Deluxe Music
 Construction Set--"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(paper rustles)</em> "You want to format a file?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, I--  Is there someone else there I can talk to?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No.  No one here but me."
</ul><p>
I tried in vain for other contact numbers or the vendor of the software
(contact information for that software was conspicuously missing in my software
and documentation).  Some hours later I called the same number above and got
someone who gave me decent information.  He had no clue what woman I talked
to earlier.  Could have been janitorial staff for all I knew.
<p><hr><p>
I was troubleshooting a powerbook for a user, which had been flaky
all of it's short life, when it refused to boot and I could smell
something smouldering.  Clearly there was a short-circuit somewhere,
probably in the power supply.  I called Apple to get it repaired under
the warranty.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Hi, I have a problem with a powerbook.  It has developed a
 short circuit, probably in the power supply.  I need an
 RMA number so I can send it back; it's still under warranty.
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Please describe the symptoms."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Um, there is a short circuit somewhere.  I'd guess it's a bad
 power supply.  I can smell smouldering when I try to power it
 on, and it won't boot, and the screen is just a pattern of lines.
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, let's try troubleshooting this."
<li><b>Me</b>: "There's nothing to troubleshoot. I need an RMA number so I
 can send it back under warranty.
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, you just described three problems to me.
 We'll tackle each one and see how many we can fix."
<li><b>Me</b>: <em>(frustrated)</em> "There's only one problem, a short
 circuit in the power supply.  Something's burning inside the case;
 I can smell it when I power it on."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(as to a child)</em> "You said that you smell
 smoke, that it won't boot, and that there are funny lines on the
 screen.  We'll tackle each of these one at a time.  Now, let's start
 the troubleshooting and see if we can get it to boot."
</ul><p>
At this point, I mumbled something about the phone not being near the
computer and hung up.
<p>
The punch line is that, after the thing was shipped to Apple (twice),
it got stolen from the shipping agent's truck, and we got a brand new
model.
<p><hr><p>
I had just bought a new laser printer in the US when I received a very good
job offer for the summer in Europe. So I called the printer manufacturer's
help desk to find out if I could use the printer in Europe with 220 volts,
or if they had a low cost transformer.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Hello, I have just bought your new <em>(printer model)</em>,
 and I was wondering if I can use it in Europe with 220 volts?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hmmm...let me see....  Here, ok, it says
 that the printer works with 120 volts, so 220 volts should be enough."
<li><b>Me</b>: "What?! If it is made only for 120 volts, and I hook
 it up to 220 volts, it's going to fry."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hmmm.  You may need a surge protector."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I'm an American living in Switzerland. I prefer English software, and the
easiest way to get it is to buy directly from the United States.
<p>
So, we've recently purchased software from <em>[a company]</em> in the
States.  It had a few problems, so I called the international support line,
and please note the word 'international'.
<p>
After 45 minutes of listening to bad music at peak international phone rates,
someone came on the line.  It's a known problem, he said, and he'd send an
update right out -- he'd just need my address.
<p>
He asked for my street.  He asked for my city.  He asked for my state.  Oops,
I'm in Switzerland, and the 'state' field doesn't apply.  The tech is very
apologetic, but his software won't let him leave the field blank.  Ok, I said,
I'm from Texas, so just put Texas in there.  Amazingly, the software accepts my
four digit zip code.  But he never asked me for my country, so I double
checked.  No, there was no place for him to enter a country.  So he wrote my
address down and said he'd sort it out later.
<p>
Weeks later, the update still hadn't arrived.  I called back, waiting "only"
twenty minutes this time.  They checked, found my order, and told me it had
been sent to Canada and been returned as undeliverable.  I corrected the
mistake, and the update arrived a few days later in spite of the fact that
it was addressed to "Swaziland."
<p>
I have no idea if this company ever updated their software so the international
help line could support international addresses.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Does your Internet provider support multicasting?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes. Just download it onto your PC and it'll work fine."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I seem to have lost my IP address can you tell me what it is?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Just a minute, I'll check."  <em>(pause)</em>
 "You're using Win95 aren't you?  It's a bit complicated. Click on Start."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok, I don't need to do that--"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Please do it my way, click on Start."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Now click on Settings...Control
 Panel...Networks...TCP/IP...and now on Protocols, and there you are."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, that's where I was when I called you."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well why call me?  That's where your IP address is,
 right in front of you."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, that's where it should be, but mine's all blank."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, what do you want me to do?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Can you tell me what it is?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Of course, just a second...why didn't you ask me
 that in the first place?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't seem to connect.  Is there a problem on your end?"

<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No.  Let's check a few things."
</ul><p>
"We" check.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, looks like you'll have to re-install your net
 software.  Do you still have the disks we sent you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I've been using you guys as an ISP fully a year before
 you had handy install disks for common software."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(pause -- he clearly doesn't comprehend how
 that's even possible)</em> "Well, then you'll have to re-install Windows."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't think so.  Can I talk to someone else?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Um...just a sec."  <em>(several minute pause)</em> "You there?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "We're down in your area."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(dryly)</em> "Thank you very much."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One of our clients, an ISP, gave us a free account to use to test
their service and help us write the documentation and marketing copy for
them. I set the system up, logged on, and handed it over to my
assistant.
<p>
After about thirty minutes I passed by and noticed they were on the phone to
the technical support line, reporting a problem with the connection. I
checked what the problem was with my assistant who told me that the
web site they were supposed to connect to wasn't answering.
I checked -- sure enough the connection just timed out with the usual
'Unable to connect to server' error. I tried a ping to the server and
got no response, then decided to speak to the tech support person myself.
<p>
He was convinced the problem was with our dial-up connection, but as
soon as I got on the phone I suggested the server was down and asked if
he could check it with someone. He refused and we spent the next forty
minutes trying various things on our machine to get the connection working.
Finally I stopped him:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Look, I'm a technical consultant who tells other ISP's
 how to set up their services. I was a founder member of the largest
 ISP in the UK, I think I know the difference between your server
 being down and a probem with my machine."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I've set up two ISPs myself, I know what I'm doing, sir."
<li><b>Me</b>: "You may well have set two ISPs up, but your server is
 currently down. Can I speak to your supervisor? I don't have time to
 waste checking things I know aren't wrong."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hang on a second -- I'll just check something."
 <em>(pause)</em>  "It looks like our server is down."
<li><b>Me</b>: "I told you that 45 minutes ago. Why didn't you check that
 when I first asked -- we could have both saved ourselves a heck of a lot of time."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, we have to go through this procedure of
 checking the caller's machine."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "I'm having problems connecting to sites outside the University."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What operating system are you using?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "The latest version of Linux."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What programs are you currently running?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Nothing much -- ftp, telnet, X, Netscape, sendmail..."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "It's not our fault you can't connect anywhere
 if you're running sendmail. You have to get mail centrally."
<li><b>Me</b>: "But sendmail has nothing to do with ftp access, web access,
 or anything else."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "It's not our problem."
</ul><p>
Three months later, it was announced on the University web site
that there was an "untraced fault" on the network, and everyone had to reduce
the MTU on their computers to 1498.  A few
talks with various technicians revealed that this had been
known and repeatedly reported by a great many people, who had
received just as unfriendly a response as I had, over those
3 months. The <em>official</em> story was that the technicians
were waiting to see if the problem would clear up on its own. It
took another six months of complaints before they finally got
someone in to fix the router.

I had a problem with using my PPP connection through Linux.
The data transfers were <em>really</em> slow sometimes but fine at others.  I
played with it for a while, then finally called the help desk.  I was on hold
for twenty minutes, then:
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hi.  How can I help you?"
<li><b>Me:</b> "Hi.  I'm trying to hook up my linux box via PPP, and I'm
 running into some problems.  It works fine under 95, but I
 can't seem to get it to connect right under Linux.  I can
 resolve hostnames and even --"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Um, sir -- what kind of computer is it?"
<li><b>Me:</b> "IBM compatible.  Specifically, an Ambra."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Ok -- what happens when you try running Trumpet Winsock?"
</ul>
I slap my forehead.
<ul>
<li><b>Me:</b> "This is Linux.  It doesn't run Trumpet Winsock."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Oh - it's a DOS program?"
<li><b>Me:</b> "No.  It's an operating system.  Trumpet runs fine under 95."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Well, have you tried running this program under
 Windows 95 then?"
<li><b>Me:</b> "No, it <em>is</em> an operating system.  It doesn't run under
 another operating system."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Oh.  Ok, so what happens when you try to run
 Winsock under it?"
</ul>
Murderous thoughts are going through my head.  After a couple more exchanges
back and forth, she finally understands that Winsock won't run on Linux for
some weird reason.
<ul>
<li><b>Me:</b> "So can I get an incident number so I can talk to a tech?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Sure.  I just need to get some info from you."
</ul>
She gets down my name, room number, phone number, computer type and
brand, then we get interesting again.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Ok, so is this under Windows 3.1 or Windows 95?"
<li><b>Me:</b> "Neither.  It's Linux."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Which type of Windows does it run under though?"
<li><b>Me:</b> "Neither!  It runs on its own!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Oh!!!  Oh!  I'm sorry, in that case we can't help
 you.  We only support Windows 3.1 and Windows 95."
<li><b>Me:</b> "<em>WHAT?!?</em>"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Sorry.  That's all we're currently supporting.
 Have a nice day."  <em>[click]</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "The ethernet card you supplied doesn't work under Linux."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Have you installed the DOS drivers?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "I'm using Linux, so the DOS drivers won't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Why not?"
</ul>

I was a manager in an IT department who had a network of around 100
point-of-sale (POS) computers spread all over Australia.  One of our
shops, about 2000 miles away, called with a problem.  The motherboard
appeared to be broken.  I called one of our technicians who was in the
area and asked him to go over and swap out the hard drive from the
machine with the broken motherboard into a machine that was in the
store room which I figured was working fine -- that way the shop wouldn't
lose any of its data.
<p>
The technician called me later and said he couldn't figure out how to get the
hard drive out of the machine.  To understand what he was looking at, I
dismantled a spare machine I had.  Thankfully IBM made the machines easy to
service -- lots of diagrams and instructions on the <em>inside</em> of the
case.  You just had to get into it first.  The hard drive was mounted on a
tray which was designed to slide out smoothly once a retaining clip had been
pressed.  Then it would be easy to unplug the drive and slide a new one in.
<p>
No matter how much I described, cajoled, and threatened the technician, he
could not figure out how to get the hard drive out. He finally got sick of it,
got in his car and drove away, leaving the shop with frustrated customers.
I called the technician's manager and explained the situation.  But he wasn't
too interested either, saying we'd have to get IBM to come and fix it (at a
huge cost, as you can imagine).
<p>
I called the shop back to explain what was going on and that they'd be down
for a while.  But the elderly lady in the shop said, "It's ok, dear.  I watched
what the technician was doing, and it didn't look that complicated.  He left
some of his tools behind, so I pulled the machines apart, swapped the disks,
and all I need to know now is how to get the cases back on."
<p>
I lead her through how to re-fit the case, and she was off and running.
<p><hr><p>
This is an actual conversation I overheard in the cube next to me.  I
only heard one side of it.  He had called the helpdesk to resolve a
network problem.<p>
<blockquote>
"Hello, my name is <em>[name]</em>.  My computer no
longer communicates on the network. . . .  Yes, the
network connection is plugged in. . . .  Yes, both ends. . . .  Ok, I've
rebooted the computer.  Still nothing. . . .  I don't have a 'Start' button.
I'm running Windows NT 3.51. . . .  Windows NT. . . .  NT. . . .  Ennnn Teeee.
. . .  I don't think that will work. . . .  Well, ok.  I'm pulling down
file <em>[long list of instructions]</em>. . . .  I don't have that menu
choice. . . .  Ok, we'll try it again.  I pull down file <em>[long list of
instructions]</em>.  That menu choice doesn't exist. . . .  Yes, thank you, I
do know how to spell. . . . No, there is no menu choice by that name. . . .
I'm sorry, it isn't there. . . .  No, I do not have a 'Start' button. . . . No,
I am not running Windows 3.11.  I am running Windows NT 3.51. . . .  Uhhh, no,
I don't think they are the same thing. . . .  Look, you can keep saying that
the choice has to be there, but in fact it is not.  I'm running Windows
Ennn Teee.  It's different from Windows 3.1. . . .  No, the choice third from
the bottom is <em>[name of option]</em>. . . .  I AM NOT LYING TO YOU. . . .
Hello? . . .  Hello?"

My co-worker redials.<p>
<blockquote>
"Hello help desk?  My name is <em>[name]</em>.  I called a few minutes ago
with a network problem.  I'd like the name of the tech assigned to my
case. . . .  Thank you.  Now, could you assign a different person to the case
please? . . . Because she's a moron. . . .  Yes, I did say moron. . . .
Thank you."

<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I'm calling to find out if the modem that was bundled
 with my system has Non-Volatile RAM.  It doesn't appear to work, if so."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Have you run 'MemMaker'?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Multitasking a Pentium is like
 stepping on the motherboard with running cleats."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I was waiting in a computer store for a price quote once, and while I
was waiting I noticed one of the technicians trying to fix a customer's
computer. I listen in on the conversation.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You see when I put my mouse over 'Documents'?
 How it turns yellow?"
</ul><p>
It was clear the customer had changed the Windows 95 colour
scheme from the standard green background and blue and white windows
that you see when Windows 95 starts for the first time. He had a new
color scheme altogether, a blue background, and when he ran his mouse to
highlight something, it turned yellow instead of the original blue.
Perfectly normal, I thought; almost every Windows 95 user changes the color
scheme.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, I see that. What about it?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "That means you have a virus."
</ul><p>
Of course, that was it. I wasn't going to buy a system from a store
with this incredible tech support, so I left.
<p><hr><p>
I had a friend who gave me a Mitsubishi monitor. The monitor
wasn't getting a picture for some reason, so it obviously needed some
servicing. I took it to a repairman to see what could be done.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Technician </b>: "You mean you get no picture at all when you boot up
 your computer?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "That's right."
<li><b>Technician </b>: "Oh, that's because you have a small hard drive. You
 have to get a bigger hard drive and then the monitor will work fine."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I originally bought a certain brand of computer that supposedly came
with a video card that had 2 megs of memory.  After a while, noting that
the screen graphics were moving very slowly, I went into the
Windows 95 Control Panel to take a look.
<p>
Video memory:  1 meg.
<p>
So I checked with a diagnostic program.
<p>
Video memory:  1 meg.<p>
I called the tech support people about this.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Oh, the Control Panel just tells you how much
 video memory you are using right now, you really do have 2 megs in there."
</ul><p>
Pardon me, but if my Windows 95 desktop takes up 1 meg of video memory just
sitting there, we have a problem.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, you need to go out and buy <em>[a brand name
 diagnostic program]</em> and check the video memory, because that is
 the only one I know how to use.  Don't worry, it'll tell you you have
 2 megs of video memory."
</ul><p>
Um, I need to buy a $50 piece of software so that I can tell you something I
already know?<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, this particular motherboard/chip/etc is
 registered with the FCC, and I have the specs right here!  It has
 2 megs of video memory!"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Maybe the <em>specs</em> say so, but my computer doesn't."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, you can just ask the FCC if you need to!
 Your computer is <em>[a certain type]</em>, and that type has 2 megs
 of video memory -- so your computer does too."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "It is still under warranty.  Can I have someone take
 a look at it and check to see if something is wrong?  It only has
 1 meg of video memory."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "No, it has <em>2</em>!"
</ul><p>
He couldn't seem to grasp the difference between a written set of
specifications and a material object -- namely, my computer.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Here, I'll have my supervisor come and read
 you the specifications for your computer!"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Um, I have the specs right here.  And yes, this
 computer should have 2 megs of video memory.  But it <em>doesn't</em>,
 and <em>that</em> is why I'm on the phone with you!"
</ul><p>
I <em>finally</em> managed to get the guy to give me the number of the local
computer tech so I could take it in.  The computer tech looked at
it, said, "Hmm.  It only has a 1 meg video card in it," traded it out,
and I got my computer back.
<p><hr><p>
The following is a three-way conversation between customer support for a company
that sells computers, a customer of said company, and a technician that was
called in to repair the hard drive of a machine from said company.
There's one brain among the three of them, and it's not hard to figure out
which one has it.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer Support:</b>  "Customer support center this is Allen."
<li><b>Technician:</b>  "Ya, this is the 'CE' from <em>(company)</em>.
 I was called in to fix yer hard drive.  I put one in but now it's
 asking for a reference disk."
<li><b>Customer Support:</b>  "All our systems are shipped with reference
 disks.  They should be in a box called 'reference disks' there
 next to the computer."
<li><b>Technician:</b>  "Oh, here they are, do I put it in now?"
<li><b>Customer Support:</b>  "Yes, and reboot the computer.  It will come up
 to a configuration screen and all you have to do is follow the
 prompts.  Are you sure you're a service guy?"
<li><b>Technician:</b>  "Look, I've been working on PC's for over 10 years
 now; I know enough to reboot.  Geeez!  Oh, wait, it says,
 'There were no configuration files found for devices in
 slots 1, 2, 4...please remove your reference disk and
 insert disk containing the correct configuration.'  What do I do now?
<li><b>Customer Support:</b>  "Look in the box.  There should be the original
 disks that came with the network card, the scsi controller, and the
 modem.  You'll have to put them in one at a time as it asks to update
 your reference disk.  What kind of network card is in the machine?"
<li><b>Technician:</b>  "It's a microchannel card."
<li><b>Customer Support:</b>  "Not what <em>brand</em>.  What type?  Token ring?  Ethernet?"
<li><b>Technician:</b>  "How do I tell?  Oh wait, the customer wants to talk to you."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  <em>[yell, yell, curse, curse]</em>  "What do we pay you for??"
<li><b>Customer Support:</b>  "Calm down."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "We have a box here that says use these disks to
 reconfigure the computer.  Maybe he should be using these instead."
</ul>
Hours go by.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer Support:</b>  "There, now reboot the computer, and it should
 all be finally working fine."
<li><b>Technician:</b>  "Hmmmm.  It says invalid or missing command interpreter."
<li><b>Customer Support:</b>  "Were there any error messages when you
 formatted the new drive?"
<li><b>Technician:</b>  "Formatted the new drive?  I just put it in outta the box."
<li><b>Customer Support:</b>  <em>[taking a big gulp of cold coffee]</em>
 "That's ok, we can do that now.  Put in a boot disk, and we'll
 format the drive and then restore the system from tape."
</ul>
Dead silence.
<ul>
<li><b>Technician:</b>  "I don't think we have a backup tape."
