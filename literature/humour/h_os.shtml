<H3>1.3 Operating Systems</H3>
<blockquote>
<h4>
Most computer users understand that a computer needs an operating system,
 even if it is not clear why. But many users don't.

A girl walked into the computer center where I work.  She said she
was having problems with her Mac.  I asked what kind of Mac she had.
In an indignant voice, she replied, "Duh, Intosh."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What operating system are you running? Windows 95?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(a little too excited)</em> "95, 97, 98, I've got them all!"
</ul><p>
After conferring with her husband, it turned out she owned a Macintosh
with System 8.1.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b> "I don't use DOS. What would happen if I deleted that directory?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Overheard in a classroom:
<ul>
<li><b>Student</b>: "How much do Windows cost, and do you have to buy
each one separately?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "How much do Windows cost?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Windows costs about $100."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh, that's kind of expensive.  Can I buy just one window?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Friend</b>: "Hey, cool Mac! Does it have Windows!?"
<li><b>Me</b>: <em>(incredulous stare)</em>
<li><b>Friend</b>: "Oh, wait, that was stupid. All Macs have Windows."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Two night forepersons at our company were discussing our new computer network
after just having been to a brief orientation session.  One of them wanted to
know what "windows" were, so I explained.  Just as she seemed to be catching
on to the concept, the other foreperson piped up.  "Well that's great, because
we have ninety-five windows on there!"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Do you have any windows open right now?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Are you crazy woman, it's twenty below outside..."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Co-Worker</b>: "What version of DOS does UNIX run?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Co-Worker</b>: "Does a firewall need an operating system?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "How can I help you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, everything is working fine, but there is one program that is not."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What program is it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It's called 'MSDOS Prompt'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What's wrong with it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I click on it, a black screen shows up with
 NOTHING but a sign that reads: 'C:\WINDOWS&gt;', and it just sits there
 and doesn't do anything. I have to turn off the system to go back to Windows."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
For my work-study job, I work tech support at a small college.
One night I was working Help Desk and the phone rings.  I pick it up to
have a student telling me she can't get the computer to work.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "What operating system are you running?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "Hunh?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Do you have a Mac or a PC?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "Um, I don't know."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok.  What does the screen look like?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "It's yellow."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok.  What does it say on the computer CPU?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "What's that?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "The big grey box."
<li><b>Student</b>: "It doesn't say anything."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Never mind that...do you have a little 'Start' button at the bottom of the monitor?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "Monitor?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "The thing that looks like a TV sceen sitting on the grey box."
<li><b>Student</b>: "Oh!  That!  No.  No start button."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok.  Is there a little apple symbol anywhere on the screen?"
<li> <b>Student</b>: <em>(very puzzled)</em> "Why would I have fruit on my computer?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Back in the early days of Windows 95:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I have Windows Thirty One."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, this program requires either Windows 95 or Win32s.
 Do you have Win32s on your system?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, I have Windows Thirty One, not Thirty Two."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Windows 3.1 is the operating system. Win32s is a
 program that makes your computer fast like Windows 95."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What's Windows Ninety Five got to do with it?"
<li><b>Tech Supprort</b>: "You need either Windows 95 or Win32s to run this."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I HAVE THIRTY ONE! WHY WON'T IT WORK?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(giving up)</em> "Ma'am, your computer is too
 old. Buy a new one with Windows 95."
<li> <b>Customer</b>: "I've heard about Windows Three Hundred and Eleven.
 Wouldn't that be better than Ninety Five?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
My father decided that it would be a nice surprise to install Windows 95
on my seven year old computer.  He had one of his employees give him
step-by-step written instructions but neglected to mention that my
computer is so old.  When I got home he had Windows 95 installed and was
struggling to install the first piece of software.
<ul>
<li><b>My Dad</b>:  "It says there's insufficient disk space.  How much
 stuff to you have on the hard drive?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "It was almost full.  You shouldn't have been able to get
 Windows 95 on there."
<li><b>My Dad</b>:  "Well, I just followed these instructions."
</ul><p>
I looked at the instructions and saw that he had backed up everything and
wiped the hard drive.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "If you followed these instruction properly, the only thing on
 the hard drive should be Windows 95.  How much space does that take up?"
<li><b>My Dad</b>:  "It doesn't take up any space. It's an operating system."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "No, it takes up a lot of space, and it shouldn't even be
 able to fit on this computer."
<li><b>My Dad</b>:  "No, you don't know what you're talking about.  The
 problem is that you have too many files. You have to delete some of them."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "You already deleted all my files.  They're on that stack of disks now."
<li><b>My Dad</b>:  "Yes, and those disks are taking up too much space."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A friend just got his new Aptiva/Win98 system and bought a bunch of software
to go along with it.  He installed everything, then complained that when he
started his computer up, the screen was so cluttered he was having a hard time
finding his desktop.  I talked him through the process of making his desktop
a more simple place by turning off fancy wallpaper, toolbars, and so on.
He rebooted and said it was just as bad as it ever was.  Sighing, I took a
quick trip over to look at it.<p>
Somewhat to my amazement, I discovered that every time the computer booted up,
a half dozen or so program groups opened up on the desktop, and all sorts of
programs were spilling their menu contents onto the screen.  After some
poking around, I discovered that he had installed everything --
<em>everything</em> -- into his StartUp folder.<p>
I asked him why he installed all his programs in there.  He said, "Well, I
wanted to be sure they'd start up when I needed them, so...."
<p><hr><p>
My father likes to delete things from the Windows System directory because he's
convinced that's where the swap file lurks.  I have to reinstall Windows 95
almost every day.
<p><hr><p>
About two months ago, a client called in screaming profanities at me
and demanding that I either give him a refund on his one year old system or
send a technician out to repair it immediately.  His problem was that the
taskbar was on the right-hand side of his screen, and he couldn't get it back
to the bottom.
<p><hr><p>
A few days ago, a client called in wondering why he
couldn't delete items off the Windows desktop. It
was soon discovered that he'd already dragged
Internet Explorer, MS Outlook, and a few other items
off into the recycle bin, and was trying to delete
'My Computer' and 'Network Neighborhood.'
<p><hr><p>
My coworker (who uses Windows 95) was having trouble downloading a
self-extracting archive off the net. In an attempt to make it easier to
open the file with WinZIP, he associated *.EXE with WinZIP.<p>
Nothing worked after that. Every program he tried to run would load WinZIP
first. He couldn't even run REGEDIT to delete the association.<p>
He ultimately had to reinstall Windows 95 and all his programs.
<p><hr><p>
From a Windows 95 user:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I think my computer doesn't know what it is doing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(pause)</em> "Why? What is the problem with the system?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, it keeps asking me, 'What is this?'"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I keep getting an error message whenever I try using
 the MSDOS mode in Windows 95."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Can you describe what happens?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I keep getting a black screen with an error
 message saying, 'C:\WINDOWS&gt;'."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Something's wrong with my computer."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Like what?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "When I turn it on the screen goes all black."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Totally black?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Does it say 'C:\&gt;' in the corner?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Then it's not really all black, is it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I guess not."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Type 'win' and press the enter key."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I work at an office supply store.  When Windows 98 came out, we had a sale on
new computer systems.  There were more than a few people who were completely
taken in by buzzwords and had no idea what they were talking about.  The
worst case was a person who spent five or ten minutes looking through
Windows Explorer, apparently trying to find something.  Trying to make the
sale, I stayed with her, helping her when necessary.  Eventually, I asked to
know what she was looking for.  "I'm trying to run Windows 98," she said.
<p><hr><p>
Read in a message board of a local BBS:  "I try to avoid using Microsoft.
That's why I use MS-DOS."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What software are you using to backup?
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ms. Dos."  <em>(spoken like it was a person, like
 Mr. Dos or Mrs. Dos)</em>
<li> <b>Tech Support</b>:  "What, are you just copying the files with the
 xcopy or copy command?"
<li> <b>Customer</b>: "Oh, no I use Ms. Backup for that."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
We maintain a 24 hour, 800 number call desk for our maintenance contract
customers, a very expensive undertaking. Non-contract customers can call as
well, but our per-call maintenance charge is $250/hour, with a minimum of
three hours. If you only call us occasionally, it's a lot cheaper than a
contract, but it's clearly designed to discourage trivial calls.<p>
In 1996 a per-call customer called. "What does MSDOS stand for?" she asked.
We told her.  Her firm paid the $750 bill without demur.
<p><hr><p>
One time a user was trying to clean up his hard drive.  He saw a
folder called "system" which took up lots of space but only had a
few things in it.  So he moved the fonts and sounds to a new
location and deleted everything else.
<p><hr><p>
One of our users, upon receiving his new computer, deleted everything
most of the files in the system area.  He said he didn't know what those
files did, so he got rid of them.  For some strange reason, the system
refused to work properly afterward.
<p><hr><p>
Had a user that called the other day, complaining that all her files
were "garbage" and that I should take her computer back and fix them.
It turned out she was looking at system files (MSDOS.SYS, etc).  She couldn't
read the binary code and assumed, therefore, that the files were corrupted.
<p><hr><p>
I was asked to fix Word Perfect once, when it had apparently "just quit
working."  They didn't know why, but it didn't take long for me to find the
problem.  They had cleaned up their hard drive by erasing all binary files
because "they weren't readable."
<p><hr><p>
One user -- a regular caller of ours -- got herself into some serious
computer trouble when she set about cleaning up her system.  She had been
exploring the hard drive in the file manager and discovered hundreds of files
in the Windows directory with all different file extensions.  Being of an
orderly mind, and with several hours of free time, she had created a TXT
folder, a COM folder, a DLL folder, and so forth, and moved all the files
into these subdirectories.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "You really should exit Windows before you shut down."
<li><b>Friend</b>: "Why?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Well, otherwise you could end up with fragmented files and
 hard drive errors and that sort of thing."
<li><b>Friend</b>: "Oh well. Who cares about hard drive errors?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My machine won't do anything."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What's on the screen right now?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It's frozen, it's showing my Windows desktop."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Try hitting Ctrl-Alt-Delete, tell me what happens."
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(taptaptap)</em> "Nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did you hit all of them at once?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Umm...just a second."  <em>(taptaptap)</em>  "I
 did that time. Nothing happened."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Try it again."
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(taptaptap)</em>  "No, it's just sitting there."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Move the mouse around. What happens?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Nothing, the arrow doesn't move."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, last try, hit Ctrl-Alt-Delete again."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Still nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hit your numlock key. Does the light flash?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, you're going to have to shut your computer off.
 Just press the power button, wait for a couple of seconds, and turn it on again."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I've heard that's bad for Windows."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Um, well, you can't do anything else, right?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, you can't hurt it any worse then."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "But I've heard it's bad for Windows to just shut it off
 without shutting down first."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, but it's locked up. There's nothing else you can do."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Will it hurt my Windows?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Probably no worse than it already was by locking up."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well...ok...but if it doesn't work, will you come over and fix it for me?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I put my foot in my mouth rather firmly once.  I was teaching a new user some
basic UNIX commands just so she could get around on the computer when she
needed to.  I thought I was doing pretty well, but, in a moment of self-doubt,
she said that she didn't think she'd ever learn how to use a computer.  My
feeble attempt at consoling her follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Me:</b>  "Don't worry.  You'll get the hang of it.  When I first
 started using UNIX, I didn't even know how to change directories!"
<li><b>Her:</b>  "What's a directory?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "File manager?  What's that?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "How long have you had your computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Three years."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Talking to a Mac user:
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "When was the last time you rebuilt the desktop?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Did what?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "How long have you owned this computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Four years."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A customer walked into the computer store I work in, wanting to return a
computer.
<ul>
<li><b>Me:</b>  "Sure, is it defective?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No, that's not the problem.  When I took it home and
 turned it on, I realized it was only half programmed."
<li><b>Me:</b>  <em>[scratching head]</em>  "What do you mean by half programmed?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, look at the computer on display."  <em>[points
 to the Windows 95 desktop]</em>  "Do you see how all the
 programs are on the left side of the computer?"
<li><b>Me:</b>  <em>[biting tongue]</em>  "Well, you are right sir, I will take your computer back."
</ul>
I decided the moron had to solve his life before he could buy a computer.
<p><hr><p>
A guy at our company asked to have Lotus Notes installed on his Mac.  He
said he'd be away for a couple days, and I could install it then.  When I went
to do it, there wasn't enough disk space, but there was about 96 megs in the
trash.  Ah, I thought, he's forgotten to empty it.<p>
When the user returned to work, he came straight to see me after switching
on his machine.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Him</b>:  "Where're all my files?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "What files?"
<li><b>Him</b>:  "The ones I was keeping in the trash."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Recently, I had a guy from the local tech school come in for an interview
for my computer assistant job opening.  I was taking him around the
office, trying my best to explain to him what my job entails and what he'd
be doing if he worked for me.  One of the very first things I showed him
was our NT server, which runs Wincenter Pro, a third-party enhanced
version of Windows NT Server which allows us to have multiple people
logged into the same NT box and to start up a remote NT session from an
X-Windows desktop.  He was pretty impressed by that, having been trained
in a vanilla NT environment.  The next thing I showed him was one of our
old DG 300 UNIX workstations.  He scoffed along with me when I explained that
the workstation used an old 16mhz Motorola processor, so it was not
exactly fast.  The interview seemed to be going well up to this point,
with the guy seeming to understand most of the stuff I was throwing out
(even the stuff I wasn't too sure about myself) until I happened to
mention that the DG workstation, along with all the other workstations and
servers in our office (save the NT server, of course) ran DG/UX 5.4R3.10:<p>
<ul>
<li> Me: "Yeah, and this thing runs DG/UX 5.4R3.10."
<li> Him: "What's that?"
</ul><p>
He stares blankly.  My heart sinks.<p>
<ul>
<li> Him: "So does that run as a thread under NT?"
<li> Me: "No.  It's an OS.  It just runs by itself."
<li> Him: "Oh oh, so you start up NT, then--"
<li> Me: "No.  UNIX.  It's an operating system.  It runs by itself, not under NT."
</ul><p>
He stares blankly.  So much for this prospective employee.
<p><hr><p>
Two girls walked into the University's Linux cluster one time.  They were
obviously unfamiliar with computers and chatted with each other trying to
figure everything out.  I was doing my own work and had tuned out a lot of
the conversation, but at one point one of them turned to me and asked how
to get into Windows.  "Type startx," I replied, for the Linux machines booted
to a shell prompt, and you had to type "startx" to get into X-Windows.  I
never did find out if that worked for them or not, but they spent quite some
time trying to correlate the instructions they had on paper (presumably given
out in one of their classes) with what they were seeing on the screen.
A full hour and a half passed, and finally one of them turned to me again and
asked if this was the Microsoft Windows cluster.  "No," I replied, "that's
downstairs."  It was hard to stifle the laughter until they were gone.  An
hour and a half before they realized they weren't even using the right
operating system.  Wow.
<p><hr><p>
A lab technician (legendary, where I work) deleted a large and seemingly
useless file named <em>/vmunix</em> from a Sun workstation.  (This file
is the UNIX operating system image.)  The machine worked fine until I
tried to reboot it.
