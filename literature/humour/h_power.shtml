<H3>2.1 Power</H3>
<blockquote>
<h4>
Most people understand that electrical appliances require
electrical power to work.  But computers, with their
surprisingly effective ability to eliminate rational thought,
cause many people to forget completely that computers require
electrical power.

I worked with an individual who plugged his power strip back into itself
and for the life of him could not understand why his system would not
turn on.
<p><hr><p>
At my high school, a computer science class student was having trouble getting
his computer to work.  The computer was one of those were the monitor could
plug into it for power instead of having the monitor plug directly into the
wall.  Well, this student's computer had the monitor plugged into the wall,
and the computer plugged into itself.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My computer won't work. You guys must have broken it
 when you installed the modem."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What happens when you turn it on?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It won't turn on anymore!!!!!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "So you don't see any lights or hear any noise?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm telling you it WON'T TURN ON."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is it plugged in?
<li><b>Customer</b>: "OF COURSE it's plugged in, you MORON!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "When you push the power button it--"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Power button? This computer doesn't have a power button."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, all computers have power buttons. Look
 at the front of the case, find the word 'power,' and push the button."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "YOU FIXED IT!!  Thanks!!!!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, I've turned the computer off, then on again.  It
 still says, 'Safe to power off, or press any key to reboot'?"
<li> <b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, not the monitor switch, the CPU switch."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I bought this computer from you two hours ago, and it
 doesn't work!  I want my money back!"
<li><b>Store Clerk</b>:  "Let me see..."
</ul><p>
So I plugged the computer in and turned it on.  I showed him that it was
working, then I turned it off.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Store Clerk</b>: "Sir, this computer <em>does</em> work.  I'm afraid
 we can't take it back."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "How in the world did you turn it on?"
<li><b>Store Clerk</b>:  "I pressed the power switch."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "You must have pressed something else, because I know
 for a fact that the power switch doesn't work!"
</ul><p>
He reached over and pressed the reset button repeatedly.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "You see?"
<li><b>Store Clerk</b>:  "Sir, that's the reset button.  This is the power switch."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "That's a switch?  I thought it was a decoration!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
There was a fresh influx of new employees at my place of work,
which used Sun workstations.  These particular workstations had
extremely well hidden power switches, so I was fielding questions
about turning on the computers for a few weeks.  Most were simply
"Where's the stupid power switch?" but one was unique.  A new employee
came around and said she had a problem turning on her computer.  I
started to tell her where to find the power switch, but she
interrupted me.<p>
"Oh no," she said. "I found the switch, but I don't know which way to
flip it."
<p><hr><p>
A lady in our department bought a new computer but coudn't get it to
work.  I told her to bring it in, and I'd take a look at it.  Next day
she dropped it off, and I checked it out.  All was fine.  She
took it home.  Next day, she came in and said it still didn't work.  I
told her to bring the monitor in, thinking maybe it was dead.  Next day,
same story, no problem with the monitor.  When I saw her later, I told
her this and that she should take the monitor home and, if it still didn't
work, bring everything in.  Next day, she dropped by my office with all
she had.  I set it on the table, plugged everything in, flipped the CPU power
switch, and she leaned in real close, wide-eyed.  "Wait!!" she exclaimed.
"What was that you just did?!?!?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, so your monitor is not working, the screen is
 blank, and no matter what you do it stays blank?  Do you see
 that button on the bottom right hand side of the screen?  Press
 it. . . .  Great, talk to you next time!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I do tech support at a computer parts vendor and system builder. I take
calls from dealers and other technical professionals. Last week I had a call
from a woman who began her call by giving me a long listing of her
credentials, beginning with her four years at MIT, covering her ten plus
years of service in the tech support departments of various technology
corporations, and ending with her forming a successful computer consulting
and repair service. Then she asked her question:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Do I have to plug in this new power supply to make it work?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I visited a customer site.  The problem was that the computer wasn't powering up.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I connected everything, but when I push the
 power button nothing happens."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok, are you sure you plugged in the power cord?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes."
</ul><p>
I crawled under her desk.  No power cord.  I sat and turned around, and
there she was holding the cord.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, I have this, is it important?"
</ul><p>
Duh!  I plugged it in, powered it up, and spent a few minutes setting her
computer up for our network and explaining how it works (not surprisingly, this
took more time then the actual install).  Then she informed me about another
problem she was having.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I think my printer is broken.  It won't turn on.  Do
 you think this will help?"
</ul><p>
And there she was, holding the power cord for the printer.
<p><hr><p>
I worked in technical support at Silicon Graphics about a year ago,
and I was part of the group that was first in line to handle problem
calls. Oh, joy. Being only eighteen at the time, my experience in the
field of technical support was somewhat limited, but I could still handle
my own.<p>
Now, as you may or may not know, SGI sells top of the line computers
used in many different industries.  On average, they're about three times
as expensive as personal PCs and are meant to be used by professionals
in the industries they're used in.<p>
Anyway, the following call came in:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I just received an Onyx yesterday, and I tried to
 set it up today and it doesn't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "It just doesn't boot up?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "It doesn't even turn on. I see nothing on the screen,
 and the fan doesn't even turn on in the back of the system."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Is the monitor functioning? Is there a little
 green light in the lower right corner of the monitor?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, there is."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, is the computer plugged in?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(irritated)</em> "Look, I think I know how to set
 up a system. I'm a college graduate, you know."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, let me finish typing up this report, and I'll
 send it off.  You will get a reply within one business day."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(exasperated)</em> "Thank you. Geez, I mean I
 paid a huge amount of money for this computer. The least you people
 can do it make sure it works before sending it to me!
</ul><p>
I roll my eyes as I continue to type.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I mean, to add to the poor quality control, you even
 sent me one extra power cord."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "One extra cord?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, it looks just the one I used to plug in the
 monitor and computer, but that's all you sent to me. I have no use
 for this other one."
</ul><p>
At this point, I thought I should inquire a little more...but use a bit of
tact to do so.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sir, can you double check the serial number on
 the back of your computer?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "On the back of the computer?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Yes, sir."
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(sigh)</em> "All right, all right, hold on..."
</ul><p>
I heard a few muffled grunts as he crawled over his desk to see the back of
the computer.  He repeated the serial number from the sticker.  I didn't
bother to verify it.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Thank you, sir. Oh, by the way, can you check to
 see if the computer is plugged in?"
</ul><p>
Dead silence.  I could just picture the man's face when he realized that
the computer was never plugged in in the first place and that the "extra"
power cord he was holding in his hand was for the computer.  I didn't wait
for a response from him.  I thanked him for calling, hung up, and closed
the case.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Hello? My computer's power just died."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok. Is everyone else's computer in that room working?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What were you doing right before it went out?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I plugged my curling iron into the power strip."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Really? What else is plugged into there?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, my radio, my space heater, my cup warmer, my
 printer, my monitor, and my computer."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did you unplug anything to plug your curling iron in?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, my space heater."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, unplug the curling iron and plug the space
 heater back in."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Hey! My computer is working now! Is there something
 wrong with the power strip?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A long time ago, I worked as a helper in a college computer
facility.  On the first day of a class, the instructor told the students to
turn on their machines.  He dutifully explained that not only do you have to
flip the big switch located at the rear right (these were old XT and
AT machines) but also to turn the switch on the monitor.  One
intelligent-looking fellow followed the instructions to the letter. He
flipped both switches but did not see the screen light up.  He tried
both switches again but still no luck.  He tried this for 20
minutes to no avail.  You're probably guessing the plug was out, or
the contrast knob was turned all the way down. Nope.  The computer was
already on when he got there, but the monitor was off.  He never managed
to get both turned on at the same time.
<p><hr><p>
We had just purchased a new Power Mac after having used a Performa
series Mac for some time.  We had been taking turns using the new
computer all evening; around 10pm everyone started turning in --
everyone except for mom.  She used the computer for a couple more
hours and just before going to bed, a problem arose.  She kept trying
to solve it but to no avail -- so she called tech support for help.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "How can I help you?"
<li><b>Mom:</b>  "Could somebody there please tell me how in the world to shut
 down my computer...I've been trying to shut down for the past three hours!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "You just press the button."
<li><b>Mom:</b>  "I've been doing that and the computer keeps restarting!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Tell me what you are doing."
<li><b>Mom:</b>  "I go to the 'Special' menu, and then to 'shut down,' and
 release the mouse button.  It doesn't shut down -- it gives
 me a dialog box that says, 'It is now safe to shut down your
 computer,' with only one button that says 'restart.'  And
 when I press it, my computer restarts.  How do I get it to
 shut down?  It has been restarting for the past three hours!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, not that button.  The little white button in
 front of the computer.  You know, the one you use to turn it on."
<li><b>Mom:</b>  "Ohhhhh, that one."
</ul>
Mom feels very embarrassed.  In fact, if she needs any assistance
from Apple any more, she has ME call them because she thinks that
when she gives them her name they will see the word "idiot" next
to her name on the screen.  I try to tell her it's not as bad as
she thinks, but she thinks it is the stupidest thing anyone has
ever done.
<p><hr><p>
One day, our Society Editor was typing away at her terminal.  As I
passed her desk, she asked me to turn up the brightness on the
monitor, because it was too dark.  As I leaned over to twist the
brightness knob, I noticed that the power switch was in the off
position.  She had been typing her story on a deactivated computer
and didn't even notice.
<p><hr><p>
I installed a simple peer to peer network for a client with 2 PC's,
and a printer.  Everything was fine for a while until I got a panic call:
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Help me, I can't print or read so-and-so's files anymore."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, can she print and access the files?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No, she's not here today."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, go to her pc and try to print the file."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, but I'm kinda busy and it takes so long for her PC
 to boot up when I turn it on."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "You mean you're trying to print to a printer hooked
 to her PC and access files on her computer, and it's not turned on?!"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No, it's not on; does it have to be?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I work on the helpdesk for a very large hotel chain.  One day, one of
our hotels called in reporting that the system wouldn't power on.  After
going through the usual -- making sure that the correct power button is
being pressed, checking to see that it's plugged in, checking the
outlet, etc -- I had determined that the power supply had probably
failed and needed to be replaced.  Just as I was about to end the call
and dispatch a technician, the desk clerk stated very matter-of-factly,
"Oh, by the way, lightning hit our hotel last night.  Do you think that
might have something to do with it?"
<p><hr><p>
A customer telephoned us.  His PC had been struck by a power surge caused
by lightning.  We asked him why he didn't switch off the computer when the
storm started.  He replied, "I was going to, but it said, 'Please wait while
Windows shuts down.'"
<p><hr><p>
I am a computer teacher for our elementary school.  I recently had a
workshop where I was showing the teachers some educational uses for the
Internet.  Teachers are often the worst students, so I asked them to turn
off their monitors so they would listen instead of playing on the
computer.  I showed them where the monitor button was located.  However,
when I asked them to turn the monitors back on to use the computer, at
least half of them pushed the power button on the actual computer.
I sometimes have this problem with my primary students (kindergarten through
third grade) if they have never used a computer before.  Just
like their teachers I guess.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have a PS/2 9556, and it's been running slowly the
 last couple of days. I know a bit about computers, and I was
 wondering -- if the battery inside it starts to run down -- could
 that be causing this?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A customer walked in to the store and said that his radio was broken.  So of
course I ask if he's checked the batteries.  "Yes," he replied, "I'm positive
they are fine!"<p>
As part of what I was trained to do, I had to check the batteries anyway.  This
made the customer rather irate, but I simply informed him that it was procedure
to check the batteries.  And guess what?  The batteries were deader than a
door.  I politely pointed this out.  He replied, "But the package says they
are good until January 1998!"
<p><hr><p>
I am a process consultant, but a client asked us to help them on a
serious IT issue that no specialist could deal with (the freshman
look). For weeks, their whole network crashed around 10am almost

every day. The server and the PCs were connected to a secure power
supply network which was relying on a big set of batteries.  (It was a
private bank.)<p>
Electricians were unable to find out where the problem was. The PCs
and the server were all fine, and no special device like a defective
backup system was run at 10am.<p>
I quickly found the source of the problem. Somewhere, the electicians
messed up the installation, and a power socket in the private closet of
one of the senior executives was mistakely connected to the secure
network. Every day, the new secretary (a real beauty, by the way) went
to the closet and refreshed her hairstyle with a 1200 watt heated curling
brush...with a defective grounding.<p>
The device acted as a short circuit, re-routing the power supply to
the ground, causing the standard power supply safety to switch off,
then empty the batteries so fast you could see the needles
plummeting to empty.<p>
The bank fixed the problem by giving the secretary a bonus for her to
buy a new heated curling device.  She was so pretty and so sad that
nobody had the heart to fire her.
<p><hr><p>
PC monitors used to all plug into the back of the tower for power.  Most of
them now plug into the outlet.  I wanted to save and outlet and
purchase an adaptor so I could plug my new monitor into my tower.<p>
So I went to a small computer store and described what I wanted.  The clerk
pointed me to some ordinary wall cords -- I told him what I actually wanted
was right next to those, then went and got one and brought it back up to the
counter.<p>
The clerk protested, saying that particular cord would cause my power supply
to "burn out faster."  Dumbfounded, I just stared at him and bought it anyway.
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine, who had been using for <em>four years</em>, would still
switch the computer off by yanking out the power cord (without shutting down
Windows first).  Perhaps her professor was at fault.  His idea of an exam was
to draw, from memory, the appearance of Microsoft Word -- all toolbars, all
icons, and so forth.
<p><hr><p>

<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What happens when you turn the computer on?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "The screen just stays black."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Is the computer plugged in?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I took it to a repair shop last week, and they
 apparently fixed it so it doesn't need a power cord anymore."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Is the computer a laptop computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No, but they never gave me back the power cord so they
 must have fixed it so it didn't need it."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Go back to the repair store and get your power
 cord back.  They just forgot to give it to you."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A laptop user complained that, while hooked up to a docking station
in the office, his laptop worked flawlessly, but when he used it at home,
it only worked for an hour or so and then died.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is it plugged in the mains ok?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is the mains adaptor light on?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It doesn't have one -- just the cable
 to connect it to the phone."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, that's the modem. You should have another
 lead with a plug to connect the laptop to the mains power."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't need one of those, though, do I?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You do if you want to work for longer than
 the batteries will last."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh. I thought that was what the modem was for --
 to download more electricity from the office."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
An office technician got a call from a user.  The user told the tech that her
computer was not working.  She described the problem and the tech concluded
that the computer needed to be brought in and serviced.  He told her, "Unplug
the power cord and bring it up here and I will fix it."  About fifteen minutes
later, she showed up at his door with the power cord.
<p><hr><p>
I once instructed a user to power cycle his external modem.  What he ended up
doing was power cycling the UPS, which happened to have his computer and
every terminal in the area plugged into it.
<p><hr><p>
One time a guy phoned me to complain that Norton Utilities failed
to recover his data after he had switched off the computer without
saving his work.
<p><hr><p>
A man came in in a panic.  He had typed a document the day before and now it
was all gone.  After some investigation, it turned out that he had saved the
document <em>before</em> he had started typing it and, when finished, simply
switched the computer off.
