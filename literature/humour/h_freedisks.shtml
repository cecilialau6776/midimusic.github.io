<h4>With America Online and other companies sending diskettes and
CDROMS in the mail, computer illiterates are given more opportunities to be
perplexed and befuddled.  And scared.</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh, my gosh, I just received this disk in the mail;
 I never ordered a disk!  Am I a member?  Am I being charged for this?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I just got your software in the mail, and what I wanted
 to know was...will I be charged if I just look at the
 software?  I mean, I don't even have a modem yet."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, I got one of your free disks in the mail, but I
 don't have a computer.  I just wanted to thank you for sending this to me."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "...Ah...is that the only reason you're calling, sir?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, I just thought that was really nice of you people,
 sending me this disk.  I really appreciate it!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I received one of your disks in the mail today, and I
 want to know if I'm going to be charged for it."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, ma'am, it was a free mail-out."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "We don't even have a computer!  You know, it's really
 not a good idea to be sending people these things in the mail
 when they didn't ask for them.  That's pretty rude."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, I just want to know how to return this disk to you people."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ma'am, the software is free.  You can throw it out,
 give it to a friend, whatever you want."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "But my nephew received this in the mail, and I don't
 want him to be billed for it.  Can I get credited for this?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "We don't bill you until you actually install the
 software and register as a user."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Can you get me credited for this?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ma'am, we have not billed you for anything."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, if you can't credit me then please transfer me to
 someone who can!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I got one o' these here disks of yours.  Is this one a
 those new home security systems, that all I have to do is put
 it here in my winda, and it'll scare away burgulars?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, sir, this is for a computer.  Do you own a computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, hell, what do I need with a computer?  I just got
 me one o' them 45-inch big screen TV's.  I don't need no computer!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "You sent me this diskette.  Are you gonna send me a
 computer so I can run this?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Excuse me?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I just got your software in the mail...when are you
 sending the computer?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "You don't have a computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Nope.  But I have the software -- just send me the
 computer, and you've got a new member."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I got a disk in the mail, and I don't have a computer.
 What do I do with it?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, you could give it to a friend."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "And how do I do <em>that</em>?!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Just give it to a friend who might want to try our service."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Can I speak to a supervisor?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Why??"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "<em>Because</em> I wanna speak to a supervisor."
</ul>
She was transferred, and the tech listened in a while.  The customer said
that she didn't like the tech's answer to her question.  For some reason
known to her and her alone, suggesting that you give a disk to a friend
is unprofessional.
<p><hr><p>
One night working at technical support, this old lady called and
told me that she received our disk and said that she's afraid of it.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well ma'am, there is nothing to be afraid of.
 It's for your computer."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, I don't have a computer.  The directions say
 'install and run'.  I'm too old to run."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ma'am, could you please hold?"
</ul>
I need a brief pause to scream with laughter.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ma'am, I can assure you that you are ok."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok.  Should I call the police?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, ma'am, just throw it away."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, there is a silver thing that slides across,
 and it clicks.  What is that?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "It is safe to throw it away.  It's for a computer, ok?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "But is this a bomb?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, ma'am, just throw it away."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Now?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes, if you like."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Son, you saved my life!  Thank you, and have a nice day."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A call came from a little girl:
<ul>
<li><b>Timid Voice:</b>  "I just got your diskette today."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "How can I help you, honey?"
<li><b>Timid Voice:</b>  "It won't fit my computer."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What kind of computer do you have?"
<li><b>Timid Voice:</b>  "A Talking Whiz Kid."
