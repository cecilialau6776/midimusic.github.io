Granted, computer terminology is frequently complicated and

I was just talking to a user who had been having problems with her machine --
it was losing its settings every time she turned it on.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Her</b>: "I asked my boyfriend about it. He knows about computers,

My grandfather has recently started a course called "Computers for the
Terrified." He's nearly eighty and, although used to be an engineer within
the British Royal Airforce, is completely stuck when it comes to computers.
<p>
He came back from his first evening at this course.  When asked how it had
gone, he replied, "Yes, it was really good. I really enjoyed it,
but I really couldn't get to grips with my mole."
<p>
I stopped for a second, completely puzzled, until I realised he was talking
about the mouse.
<p><hr><p>
One day I asked if my Mom could shut down my computer.  I told
her to press "the big gray switch on the computer."  After some time,
I phoned her and asked if she shut the machine down, but she replied,
saying there wasn't any big gray switch on the keyboard.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "No, Mom, not on the keyboard; it's on the computer."
<li><b>My Mother</b>: "Computer?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Yes, that gray box on the floor."
<li><b>My Mother</b>: "Ah, the engine!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Engine?"
<li><b>My Mother</b>: "Yes, it's making lots of noise."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Once I went on site to set up a computer for a school.  I spend several
hours setting up the equipment and configuring all the software and
checking the Internet connection.  When I left, everything was working
perfectly.
<p>
The next morning, I got a call from the teacher, saying that the computer
wouldn't turn on.  Perplexed, I paid another visit.
I sat down at the desk and looked at each component: the scanner was on,
the monitor was on, the speakers were powered up, but the screen was
blank.  I looked under the desk, and, sure enough, none of the lights on
the face of the computer were lit.  I reached down, pushed the main power
button, and the computer immediately came to life and booted up normally.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Why didn't you try that?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "The light on the brain was on...."
</ul><p>
She was pointing to the speakers.
<p><hr><p>
As the local computer enthusiast, I sometimes get called on to 
troubleshoot computer problems.  A while back, my boss asked me to 
help her figure out what was going on with her computer, complaining 
that her "rat" (mouse) was not responding.  She surmised that it
was a problem with the "ropes" (cables) behind the computer.
<p><hr><p>
I had a friend who was ready for a memory upgrade on his Mac notebook,
and he wanted to know how much "megaram" he needed.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "How do I use my High Megabit memory?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "This DOS program says I have insignificant memory."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "The computer told me it had contagious memory.
 Does it have a virus?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, that is 'contiguous' memory, as in 'sequential'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "That is impossible, it said 'contagious'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Type 'mem' and hit the 'enter' key."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have 384,000 free contentious memory."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have a terminant swap file."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have a terminal swap file."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have a scummy card in my system."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I lost my blue cyanide color."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have a cursing flasher."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "It says one copy filed."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I'm in the CONSYS.FIG file."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have SETUP.EXERSIZE on my B floppy."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Customer</b>:  "I am getting an error on my computer"
<li> <b>Tech Support</b>:  "What kind of error?"
<li> <b>Customer</b>:  "It says I have a corrupted file on my hard drive,
 and I should run 'Check Disk'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, we need to call in a ticket, and someone
 will be down shortly."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Can you make sure you bring some extra Check Disks,
 because mine does not work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Uh.  We're out of stock right now, but I'll
 order some."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One day I was shopping for RAM with a friend of mine.  We checked out a
few places.  During the trip, my friend blurted out:<p>
<ul>
<li> "That was some cool RAM in there.  Pentium makes the best
	RAM, not like that cheap RAM other places got!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
The place where a friend of mine works was going through the process of
upgrading all of their computers.  On one computer in particular, they had
determined they needed more memory.  One of the senior partners got it into
her head that they needed more "Meg."  My friend tried to tell her that
what they needed was RAM, but she insisted that the machine had plenty of
RAM and that they needed more Meg -- specifically, about 16 megabytes of Meg.
He got tired of arguing with her and said to go down to the computer store
and buy some Meg.
<p>
She came back with an envelope with RAM in it -- on the envelope was written
"16 megabytes of Meg."
<p>
"The salesman tried to tell me the same thing you did," she told my friend,
"but then he went and talked to his manager, and he set him straight.  Now go
install this Meg."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well...we have the CD, but we can't find the ROM!"
</ul><p>
After some inquiry, I finally understood what she perceived the "ROM" part of
"CD-ROM" to be:  the picture.  She said a specific multimedia CD was not
displaying the ROM.  I corrected her mistaken impression, to which she said,
quote, "Huh."  I walked her through the problem, and when it was fixed, she
exclaimed loudly, "We found the ROM!  WE FOUND THE ROM!!!!"
<p><hr><p>
I needed to wipe someone's hard drive and re-install Windows, so I asked her
what she had on her system that wasn't backed up.<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Customer</b>:  "I have some data files for Mississippi Works saved."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have Microword Soft."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Microwave Windows?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Will this upgrade include Microwave 97?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Seen on a web page:<p>
<ul>
<li> "This site best viewed in Netscape Explorer."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I have Microsoft Exploder."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I have Microscope Exploiter."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have Netscape Complicator."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>A Friend</b>:  "I was using AOL, but now my ISP is Netscape."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What browser are you using, Netscape or Microsoft?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Netscape."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Could you read to me what it says at the top of the window?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "'Global Travel Conference - Microsoft Internet Explorer'."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Here's a silly one. My high school computing teacher routinely called
Word for Windows "Windows for Word" through the whole time I went
there.
<p><hr><p>
This happened when I was working for Kinko's:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I need to print out my letter here."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok, what program did you use to create it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Macintosh!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "No, what actual program did you use.  Was it MacWrite? Claris?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Microsoft."
<li><b>Me</b>: "OK, you used Microsoft Word.  We have that here, so go
 ahead and sit down at one of these Macs."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It wasn't Microsoft Word.  It was Windows!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "I need to know what kind of computer you used.  Was it a
 Macintosh or an IBM?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't think it was an IBM."
<li><b>Me</b>: "It could be an IBM compatible.  Do you remember anything about
 what kind of computer it was?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Microsoft!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Did the computer have a little apple on the front of it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I think so."
<li><b>Me</b>: <em>(What I should have done five minutes ago...)</em>
 "Give me the disk, and I'll put it in my computer and check it out."
</ul><p>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Does this come with Microsoft?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Um, well, we install Microsoft Windows on all our
 systems, unless you say otherwise."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, no, no, I need Microsoft to do my letters and stuff."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well what do you use to write your letters?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Microsoft!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, but do you use Word?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, I use Word at work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, so you'll need the Office Suite then, too."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "But doesn't this computer come with Microsoft?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, yes, it comes with Windows 95 installed."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh.  Can I type my letters with that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yesss...but you need a word processor installed,
 like Word or WordPerfect.  Our systems come with the Corel suite, but
 we can use Microsoft Office instead if you like. It just costs more."
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(thoughtfully)</em> "WordPerfect sounds familiar."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Is Corel WordPerfect IBM?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A lot of people seem to think that all computers are made
by Microsoft, and that all software is called Windows.  This story comes
from our school's computer cluster.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Student</b>: "I typed this document I wrote at home, but it won't load in here."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, what word processing software did you use at home?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "I have Windows, version 6."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Um, no, I mean, what is the name of the actual
 program you go into to write documents?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "Windows."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, not quite, that's the operating system. Maybe
 it's WordPerfect, or it could be Microsoft Word, does that sound familiar?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "Ah yeah! That's it! It's Microsoft Windows."
</ul><p>
I turn the monitor towards him and fire up WordPerfect.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "When you start it, do you see a picture like this,
 of a fountain pen?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "That's the one. Except you have Windows
 version 7 there, eh? I only have Windows version 6."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A client just called in reference to our most recent survey, which asks if they
have Microsoft Access. The client said, "Of course we have access to Microsoft
-- how else do you think we run our programs!?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>My Dad</b>:  "Ok, so I go into the Microsoft..."
</ul><p>
It usually takes two or three guesses to determine which Microsoft application
he's in.
<p><hr><p>
A few years ago I saw an advertisement that said:<p>
<blockquote>
"Required: Office Assistant: Must be familiar with Lotus One, Two, and Three."
</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Are you installing on a Mac?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No, I'm using a 3.5" thingee on a disk."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Overheard in a computer games store:
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Will this run on a Dell?"
<li><b>Salesperson:</b>  "Um, I'm not sure, sir.  What kind of processor does it have?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Um...uh....  It's a Dell."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What kind of hard disk do you have?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well...it's black with a little red light...."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hi, I need to buy a box of hard disks."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
When asking questions about setting up a new account online, the caller
asked me if she had to put an 'astronaut' (asterisk) in front of the customer
name.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Is there an asterisk to the left of the discount field?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Nope, just a 'squishy bug'."  <em>(her name for an asterisk)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine has a daughter who had started attending a
university and had decided to buy a computer on which to complete
assignments.  Her father suggested she call me for some advice on
what to buy, since he knew I worked with computers.  I answered the
questions based on her needs and thought she had a pretty good
grasp of the fundamentals of what we had discussed about RAM,
applications, windows, etc.  Until she asked, "Oh, and Mike, which
is better, hardware or software?"
<p><hr><p>
I was working for a major college in our area and we had a real neophyte
end user that was constantly having problems with her PS/2.  I went over to
find out what was wrong.  I wanted to find out what program she was
running, so I asked, "What software are you using?"  She replied, "Software?
Oh, we don't use software."  Needless to say I was totally amazed, I guess her
computer is telepathic.
<p><hr><p>
Talking to a Mac user:
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Do you have any extensions on?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I have a surge protector."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A friend had to go over to a bank and set everyone's software up.
Since all the Internet software his company supports runs under
MS Windows, he asked the manager "Do you have Windows?"  The manager
stared at him blankly and said, "No, we've got air conditioning."
<p><hr><p>
A woman called the Canon help desk with a problem with her printer.
The tech asked her if she was "running it under Windows."  The woman
then responded, "No, my desk is next to the door.  But that is a good
point.  The man sitting in the cubicle next to me is under a window,
and his is working fine."
<p><hr><p>
My mother works in a bank. She told me that every once in a while the
printer would go crazy and spit out dozens of blank pages for no reason. I
told her that sometimes happens when somebody prints a binary file that
contains unprintable characters.<p>
The next day, she proudly announced to everyone in the office
that the reason the printer goes crazy is because it's printing
"unmentionable" characters.
<p><hr><p>
I'm an employee of a major computer retail store.  Recently I saw a woman
wandering around, looking confused.  I asked her if I could help.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, I'm trying to compare these computers to see
 which one is better."
<li><b>Me</b>: "What are you looking for in a computer?"
</ul><p>
She looked at me disdainfully, as if I was the world's dumbest idiot for
having to ask.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I need a computer with <em>both</em> megabytes and gigabytes."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "How much memory is in the computer?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Eight megadrives."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What kind of modem do you have?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It's a 56 killer beet modem.  Or killer beep?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
While selling off some salvaged computers, we had a couple of 286 CPU cases
stacked together with a monitor on top; another monitor happened to be
sitting nearby. A woman asked me (pointing to the first monitor), "How come
this one comes with two risers and the other none?"
<p><hr><p>
My company publishes clip art products for the computer, so many of
the tech support calls involve people trying to use our products with
their own illustration software -- Aldus FreeHand was one of the most
popular.  One day I overheard the tech guy in the next office say to a
customer, "No, I think you mean Aldus. Adidas is the shoe."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I'm going to install Windows 75 as soon as you guys send it to me."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I've been using Windows 94 at work."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A job ad that I saw in a storefront in London in March 1998 was for someone
with "Windows 97" experience.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What version of Windows do you have?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Windows 94."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "I presume you mean Windows 95?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Of course not.  I've got the version that came out first."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
The other night I was talking to my girlfriend's father about computers.
He was complaining about the difference with his computer at home and
the one he has at work.  The one at home was a Pentium II with Windows 95.
The one at work was an old machine running "Windows 91."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "This has Windows 98 on it -- did it have Windows
 98 or 95 on it when it was sent out for repair?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I think it had Office 97."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm on Windows 96."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I'm sorry, do you mean Windows 95?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, I'm on Windows 96."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I'm sorry sir, but there is no such thing as
 Windows 96.  You must be using Windows 95."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Look, I bought this computer in 1996, so I know it has
 Windows 96 on it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(pause)</em> "Sir, buying a computer is not
 like buying a car with the different model years."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, I didn't know that."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A guy I work with came back from the dentist, puzzled. The two had been
commiserating about Windows and its instability, and the dentist
had observed, "Yeah, last night I was fooling around with the system, and I
blew out all my interrupts."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "This may sound strange, but my friend told me that if I
 emptied my cash box, it would help the Internet go faster. Ever heard of that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I believe he was referring to the cache files in
 your AOL folder."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, he specifically said cash box.  And I think
 it's the one in my Quicken software. How do I empty that?
 And what happens to my cash balance?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "We should use FTP to transfer this picture."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, we do not accept FTP, we can only use JPG."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Backsplash.  Backsplash?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Backslash."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "C colon backspl...backslash."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>My Boss</b>: "Well, I think this Windows 95 thing is gonna
 be a big blackslash for Microsoft."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>

<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "How much free space do you have on your hard drive?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, my wife likes to get up there on that Internet,
 and she downloaded ten hours of free space.  Is that enough?"

<li><b>Customer</b>: "I just shut down Windows 95, and it says, 'It is NOT
 safe for me to turn off my computer.'"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Um...are you sure?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(terrified)</em> "Yes!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, read me the screen letter for letter."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok.  I, t, i, s, n, o, w--"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "There!  It says 'now', not 'not'.  Is there
 anything else I can help you with today, sir?"

I was doing some training for an initial release of our software.
One of the students found a bug that caused the software to crash.
The student was new to computers, so I explained that the program
had crashed.
<p>
The student proceeded to look behind the laptop he was working on,
look below it, and then look at me, confused, and asked,
"What did it hit?"
<p><hr><p>
I had a lady that called up complaining that she couldn't access the Internet.
Now keep in mind she had an IBM system with a "Mwave" modem. She said that
every time she tried to connect to the Internet, it told her that there was
no dial tone.  She looked up the error message in her help documentation,
and it told her to make sure her phone line was connected.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can see that I put one end in my computer,
 but where does the other end of the phone line go?  My microwave
 doesn't have a connection that fits this plug."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I turned on my computer, and it just sits there. What do I do?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is the computer plugged in?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, of course."
</ul><p>
Through the course of our conversation, I discovered she was calling the
monitor the computer and the computer the disk drive.  So I clarified.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is the little gray tower with the slots in it
 plugged in?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, but it doesn't need to be."
</ul><p>
I helped her get the system working, but she returned it anyway.  She said,
quote, "I couldn't get no hard drives programmed into the CPU." The return
was accepted without hesitation.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm having trouble inserting my ethernet card into my hard drive."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "It's not my computer that is slow.  I have a 200 horse power hard drive."

I work as a tech for my local school district.  One day we got in a Mac
LC with a problem tag stating the following:
<blockquote>
"Need to install CD chip into hard disk drive to expand memory to accept
CD programs."
</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
I work at a computer store in the upgrades department.  One day, 
a customer came up to me and asked for a "card game."<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "A card game? You mean, like poker?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, no. I just bought a steering wheel. I need a card game."
<li> <b>Me</b>: "You mean a 'car game,' like Nascar?  So that you can use
 the steering wheel to drive?"
</ul><p>
The customer looked at me like I was a complete idiot.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No.  I have a Compaq computer.  We tried to plug
 the steering wheel in, but it didn't work so we need a card game."
</ul><p>
I was trying to figure out how a card game was going to help them out.
Instead of getting a racing game, at least a card game would work.  But it
wouldn't be very easy to play a card game with a steering wheel.
<p>
Then I figured it out.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "You mean you need a 'game card,' to plug in your steering wheel?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh, yeah.  Maybe that's what it's called."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "They're in aisle 10 with the steering wheels."
</ul>

I spoke with a woman who appeared to be knowledgeable about computers and
wanted to inquire as to which modem to purchase. She asked which ISPs were
supporting 56K modems, how noisy the phones lines were, the pros and cons
about voice modems, and so forth. After determining which modem would best
meet her requirements, she asked, "How much more hard drive space will this
give me?"  Then, before I could recover enough to answer, she asked, "Or would
a trackball be better to speed up my computer?"
