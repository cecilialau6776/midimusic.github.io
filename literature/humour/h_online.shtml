<H3>3.1 Online Folly</H3>
<blockquote><h4>
Even people who understand computers by themselves can't grasp
the concept of networks.  Dazzled by the feats networked
computers can accomplish, people are frequently deluded
into believing they can perform miracles they can't.
Other people don't understand the function of an online
service provider.  Still others "just don't get it."

A member of America Online called me (a member of the tech support staff for
an Internet service provider with no affiliation with AOL) asking what her
email address was.  After figuring out she wasn't registered with us, I
politely pointed out that we were not America Online and she might get a
better answer to her problem if she called the American Online support number.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh, so I should call them?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes, they will probably be able to help you more than I can."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "But you're an Internet Service Provider!  It says so
 right here in the phone book!  If you don't want to help me
 fine.  Thank you, have a good day."  <em>[click]</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A lady called, claiming to be a new member.  I looked under the screen name
she gave...couldn't find her.  I looked under her phone number...couldn't find
her.  I looked under her name...couldn't find her.  I resorted to her credit
card number...couldn't find her.  Finally, I asked her if she was sure it
was America Online that she signed up for.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yeah.  Well, it's called E-World on my computer, though."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Got a call today from a gentleman who was upset because ABC's "This Week
with David Brinkley" show had run long, causing the first twenty minutes
or so of a sporting event to be preempted, and he had seen AOL's blurb
at the end of the show.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, sir, ABC News does have an area on AOL but
 we're not affiliated with them....  I'm not sure I understand,
 why did you call us instead of ABC?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, things like this sure don't make America Online look good!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A lady bought a new computer from us.  Two days later she called to say that
her computer wasn't working.  She said it wouldn't connect to the Internet.
I asked her what happens after she double clicked on the globe, and she
replied, "You mean I paid over two thousand dollars for this, and I still have
to click on something to get on the net?"  She was really, truly upset.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My phone line comes from the wall and plugs into
 my hard drive."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Once I had a woman call me saying she couldn't connect to her company's
LAN remotely.  It turned out she had taken her network cable (RJ45) and
somehow jammed it into her phone line connection (RJ11).
<p><hr><p>
On this call a customer was having problems with his fax modem. It took fifteen
minutes for me to make the guy understand the concept that one must plug a
phone line into the modem for it to work. At the moment he grasped this
concept, all I got for a response was, "Oh, so I need to unplug my--"
<em>(click)</em>
<p><hr><p>
Email from a customer:<p>
<kbd>
We are going to have a second phone line put in for our computer.  What
steps do we need to take in order to switch our account over to the new
phone number?  And do we have to pay to have the account switched?
</kbd><p>
I mailed her back saying just to move the computer to the new line and conduct
business as usual.  She mailed back:<p>
<kbd>
But what about receiving my e-mail?  I thought it came to the phone number.
</kbd>
<p><hr><p>
I had been using the net for about nine months, and was spending a
lot of time on it, so I decided to shift to a flat-rate provider, of
which there was only one in our area. I headed on over to their site and
spent half an hour trying to find a way to download the installation software.
I got there in the end and tried to download the software.
<p>
Regrettably, it required a user name and password -- more specifically, a
user name and password for this ISP. In other words, you had to be a
member of the thing to be able to download the software to become a member.
<p>
So I phoned their tech support (no other way of getting a setup disk.
After only 45 minutes, I was able to talk to someone and persuade them to
send me a setup disk. I also informed them of the error regarding their
FTP server.
<p>
Some three weeks later (!) the setup disk arrived -- it was an unformatted
blank disk with a fancy sticker on it.  So I tried again to download their
software from their web site -- no such luck.  Another phone call to tech
support.  This time I got a fancy CD and another promise that the web site
would be fixed.
<p>
As of a month ago, when a friend of mine was joining, some two years after
I signed up, they still had not fixed their web site.
<p><hr><p>
One woman called a customer service number and said she always got a busy
signal when her computer called the modem pool.  She kept on calling and
calling, complaining about busy signals.  Finally, we decided to clue her in
on an experimental phone number that pointed to a few new-at-the-time 14.4Kbps
modems.  But she insisted, "No, I can't put in that number; I have to put in
my home number."  No amount of reason could get her to understand that the
computer at her home had to call the number of the modem at her service
provider.  Last we heard, she remained unconvinced, calling herself and
complaining about the busy signals.
<p><hr><p>
My friend was having trouble with her dial-up connection and was
convinced that she needed to type her new home phone number into some
property dialog to get her connection to work.  I told her I didn't
think that was important.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Her</b>:  "But how will they know where I'm calling from?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I work on the helpdesk of an oil company.  One of our users, a very high
level executive, is traveling throughout the United States and calls us,
long distance, to ask a question about setting up his dial up networking
connection:  "Do I have to dial a '1' before the number if I'm calling long
distance?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I need help with this dialer. The police have already
 shown up to my office twice today."
</ul><p>
Police?  Ok, whatever.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, let's check out the settings.  Do you have
 anything entered for getting an outside line?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "A nine."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you need to dial a 9 for an outside line?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm not sure. I think so."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Could you double check?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Sure. <em>(pause)</em>  Nope. Turns out we don't need it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok. Then remove it. What do you have for the area code?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "One and then [area code]."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Uhm, you don't need the one. Windows 95 automatically adds that."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh.  So you mean..."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, your computer was dialing 911 and then the phone number."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Do I need to call my phone company each time to let
 them know that I am going online?"
</ul>
I am sure the phone company would appreciate her calling so that they could
hold all her calls.  Yeah, right!
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "May I ask the reason you are cancelling our service?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yeah, I just moved, and the phone jack in my new
 house is too far away from the computer."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I've been sitting here for over twenty minutes with it
 saying I'm connected.  When will it do something?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I hit the 'Open Connection' button and the modem
 starts to dial.  I hear some terrible noise, and when that's
 over I hit the 'Close Connection' button.  Then I start
 Netscape but it keeps telling me that it can't locate the host."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One day I was in the school's computer lab with my class, and one of the
computers could not connect to the Internet. Since the lab attendant
nowhere to be found, my teacher asked me to help with the problem.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>My Teacher</b>: "Maybe today is a bad day for Netscape."
<li><b>Me</b>: "I think it's a physical problem."
<li><b>My Teacher</b>: "No, it's gotta be Netscape."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Yeah, you're right."
</ul><p>
When my teacher left the room, I checked under the terminal. The phone
cord had been kicked out of it's socket. I put it back in. When my
teacher came back into the room, he noticed it was working again.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>My Teacher</b>: "Well, Netscape must be feeling better now!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Is your computer on a separate telephone line?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No." <em>(clicks the button to log on to our service)</em>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well then we can't--"
<li> <b>Customer</b>:  "It says 'no dial tone'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "That's because you're on the line with me
 right now.  You need to--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, that's not it.  It does this all the time.  I
 just have to try a few times, and it will let me through."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "No, ma'am.  It's not even trying to dial
 right now because you're on the phone with me."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "It must be busy.  I'll try again later."
</ul><p>
I had given her my email address, and I got a letter from her the next
day saying:  "Thanks for the help, but I fixed it myself.  It works fine
now.  Thanks for trying."
<p><hr><p>
I work for an ISP.  This one happens to me almost daily.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What Internet software are you using?  Internet
 Explorer or Netscape?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I'm using <em>(name of ISP)</em>."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "No, when you try to access the Internet, what do
 you click on to sign on?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "<em>(name of ISP)</em>!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "If you were to try to sign on to the Internet right
 now, what icon would you click on?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't sign on, I only have one phone line."
</ul><p>
Dings and dongs sound from error messages popping up on the customer's
screen.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "If you were not talking to me right
 now and walked up to your computer because you wanted to get on the
 Internet, what is the first thing you would do?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I click on 'Netscape'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ahhh, you have Netscape." <em>(Then, with great
 hesitation...)</em> "What version?"
</ul><p>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "I can't seem to connect to the Internet. Any problems there?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What lights on your modem are on?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "'Power' and 'Network'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Okthen, it's something with your system. Do
 you use Netscape?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "My Linux server doesn't get a temporary IP address, and
 there's no PPP0 connection."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "We only support Netscape."
<li><b>Me</b>: "A web browser wouldn't work. I can't even do a ping to you
 or somewhere else outside my network."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "A ping? Are you sure you use Netscape? We only
 support Netscape."
<li><b>Me</b>: "As a matter of fact, my Windows 98 machine runs Internet
 Explorer, but it always worked fine. I really think something else
 is wrong. A ping is a signal send to see how the connection between
 two machines is. I can't seem to get a connection between you and me."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You really should install Netscape. It's on the
 install disk which came with your modem."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok, never mind."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I do some unofficial tech support for friends around campus.
One day, a couple of my female friends asked me
to look at their computers.  The symptom: "They're broken."
<p>
After much tinkering and safe-mode booting, I saw that many, many weird
(and obsolete) network drivers and protocols have been loaded, causing the
computers to freeze at the Windows login screen while they looked
for a whole mess of NICs that weren't there.  I fixed it and asked
how so many of these things had been loaded.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>My friend</b>: "Joan and I got bored, so we went into the network
 settings and added a bunch of things we didn't really understand."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, I just signed up for a SLIP account.  Is there an
 icon that's supposed to appear in Windows?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Did you install the SLIP software?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "What software?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Heard from a customer, while I was setting up his new T1 line:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "This is a Mac.  It doesn't <em>need</em> an IP address."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I work for a prominent online service and was talking with a fellow
employee.  He asked me where he could find QuickTime for Windows.  I told
him to try apple.com.  He had a puzzled look on his face for several seconds.
Then he meekly said, "You do mean the net site, right?"  I said, "What else
could I mean?"  He replied, "I thought you meant like command.com -- the
DOS file."
<p><hr><p>
A man called, and he was EXTREMELY upset.  He was yelling
and carrying on, very angry with his last ISP.  He wanted to know
our prices and services, so as always I told him what we offer and what
we could do for him.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, good, I'll go with you.  I was using
 that *^@#$%ing AOL, and I hated them &amp;^$@#%*s!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What was the problem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, EVERY single time I signed off AOL,
 this smart-@$$ guy kept telling me 'goodbye' in this smart-@$$ tone,
 so I canceled them!"
</ul><p>
It was <em>really</em> painful to repress my laughter.
<p><hr><p>
At the time, I was a junior in high school sitting in our recently built
(and still to this day broken) Novell network. After about ten
minutes of the first day I began playing with the instant message
features built into Netware 4. It didn't take long for
everyone else to start using this constantly.
<p>
Later in the week, our clueless sysadmin (who was a welding instructor
before he was promoted to district wide technology head) had botched up
several student accounts, rendering them unusable. When the student
raised her hand to complain about the login window rejecting her
password, the teacher blaimed all of the "instance messaging" flying
around, "bogging the network," and that our messages "had too many
misspellings which were confusing Netware."
<p><hr><p>
I work on an ISP help desk and got this call once.
This is my work log, with the names edited out and clarifications made:<p>
<pre>
August 1998:
   User cannot connect.
   User has MAC.
   User is getting: "Failed" when trying to connect.
   I can connect with this ID.
   User is running 8.0, 8.1, and 8.5 beta OS.
   User says he cannot connect now with any OS.
   User reports connection problems throughout the past week.
   Frequently he tries to connect, and it says he is connected, then he
       gets disconnected.
   He says it takes a couple of retries and reboots to connect for sure.
   User says he cannot get into email.
   User opened his browser, and he is not connecting.
   User says information occasionally disappears from his configurations.
   User reports: "His website is private. And the Government has scanners
       on the Internet that scan people's computers. He can always tell
       when he is being scanned, because his computer starts running
       really slow." He would not confirm if, when this happened, he just
       pulled the plug. After that, he seems to lose information in his
       Interner/Browser configurations.
</pre>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "When I bought my modem, it came with a phone cord, right?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Right."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "So I plugged it into the one modem jack and the other
 end into the other modem jack.  Was that right?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "No, that's not right."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I didn't think so.  I get 'No dialtone'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Right.  You need to plug one end of the cord
 into the modem, in the jack marked 'Line', and the other end into the wall."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(skeptically)</em>  "So I need to leave one jack open?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Er, yes."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm no computer whiz, but I was wondering which
 end of the phone cord goes into the wall and which one goes into the modem."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A user who is attempting to dial in from home calls in for help.  Nothing
works.  No matter what communications port he tries, no matter how he sets
up his software, nothing works.  This goes on for most of a day, as the user
calls, is given something to try, tries it, calls back, is given something
else to try, etc.
<p>
Finally, on about the eleventh call, our intrepid support person hears some
odd noises, and asks out of simple curiosity what they are.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh, that's traffic outside the phone booth."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Phone booth?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yeah, I don't have a phone in my apartment, so I'm
 calling from the phone booth on the corner."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Modems and pay phones don't mix.  I hotwired my laptop in to the mouthpiece
of a payphone and proceeded to do system maintenance on a customer's machine.
The sheriff arrived shortly afterward and proceeded to interrogate me.  Someone
had called complaining that I was using a computer to steal money from the
pay phone.
<p><hr><p>
A customer had a problem logging in.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Can you describe the cables connected to your computer, please?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I've only got the one cable connected to the computer."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Is it the power supply?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "You don't a phone line connected to the modem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, it's connected."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "To a phone jack?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes...that's how it gets power. My battery is dead."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "That's not a phone jack. That's a power outlet.
 You have to have the modem conceded to a phone jack. The thing you
 connect a <em>phone</em> to."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I thought it was funny that they talked to each other
 over the power lines."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't connect to you over the Internet."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, what account name are you registered under?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, I'm not registered.  I just made up things when
 it asked for my username and password."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I'm an audio/video technician for an educational medical school in
Philadelphia.  One day a professor wanted to use Power Point for a
presentation.  We were able to borrow a laptop from the Information Tech
Department.  I brought it in, set it up, booted it, and it came up with
a password screen.  I explained to the professor that I had to call up the
Information Tech Department to find out the password, but the professor
told me not to bother.
<p>
He tried his <em>own</em> name and password.  And he <em>kept</em> trying
it, repeatedly, for the next <em>hour</em>.  I explained to him that this
would not work, but he was insistent and kept trying.  So I just sat back
and laughed to myself.
<p><hr><p>
I caught the end of one of those cable TV Internet programs.  In the
last five minutes, the host said, "Every week we get thousands of
pieces of email asking 'How do I get online?'"  Neat trick.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I'm having problem with my modem account."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, tell me exactly the part you are having a problem with."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, I think you need to give me an account."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, what kind of account do you need?  An email
 account, Unix account, or Novell account?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I need a carrier account."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What do you mean a carrier account?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "When I try to dial in, it tells me 'no carrier.'  Can
 you give me a carrier account?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One employee couldn't log in to her new computer account and asked me for
help.  I asked all the routine questions, including, "Are you sure
this is the right password?"<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Her</b>:  <em>(exasperated)</em>  "I'm sure it's the correct
 password.  I typed in the one I saw <em>(another co-worker)</em> use
 to login to her machine."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "And what password was that?"
<li><b>Her</b>: "Five asterisks."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Thank you for calling; may I have your name please?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, but before I do I just want to tell you that this
 software sucks!  I have never dealt with such a ****** company,
 and I am just calling so you can cancel my account!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok sir, how long have you been a member?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Three months, And I have only been able to log on once!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok sir, before I cancel your account may I ask
 what the problem is that you've been having?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, every time I go to type in my password it won't
 let me!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "It won't let you?  What does it do when you try to
 type in the password?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "All the ******* thing does is ding!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Sir, are you in front of your computer now?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What screen is in front of you right now?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "The welcome screen, why?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Could you please hit your tab key and try typing
 your password."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, but it is not gonna.........SON OF A *****!! IT WORKED!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok sir, now would you like me to cancel your account?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Heck no, I want online!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A gentleman called tech support, as he was having problems uploading
his newly-made web page to his shell access. He told me the error
message he was receiving: "User anonymous access denied." I explained to
him that in order to log in to his shell account he needed to supply his
username and password. He got very upset, claiming to be a "network
administrator" and that he knew what he was doing, and obviously the
problem was on our end.
<p>
I tried explaining the situation to him several different ways, but
he was insistent. Finally, I asked for his password and told him to hold
on for a moment. I logged into his shell access and told him (more
irately than I should have to a customer), "I'm on your shell
account right now. If I wanted to, I could have a web page up in your
account in 15 seconds."
<p>
He was so upset at my "refusal" to help him, that he said he'd call
back when a "more qualified" techie was working.
<p><hr><p>
A customer called our PC tech support line. She had problems getting her
modem connection to work correctly.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Our dialup connection settings have changed
 recently. We have an instruction sheet which tells you how you should
 set up your connection. Have you followed those instructions?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, I have those instructions, but I couldn't
 understand a word of them, so I just installed the connection my way.
 Now it prompts me for a host name. What should I enter?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Um...there is nothing you can enter there. Logging
 in like that doesn't work any more. You really should follow those instructions."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I cannot understand them! I just did it my way, and I
 need the host name."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ma'am, there is no host name you could enter that would work."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Some help line this is. You don't know your own host name."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I work for an ISP.  One day a woman called, furious.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I bought the Internet the other day, and it ain't workin'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, ma'am, can you explain what's happening?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I called that number that you gave me, and it
 don't do nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What do you mean?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "When I call it, all it does is squeal in my ear!"
</ul><p>
Silence.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ma'am, do you <em>have</em> a computer?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Computer? Hell, I pay you twenty dollars a month! I
 don't <em>need</em> a computer!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I've worked closely with the sysops of a local BBS, who are always amazed at
the users that download a file from the system, decide that it's not what
they expected, and return it by re-uploading it.
<p><hr><p>

I had a customer who called to get our BBS number. I gave him the information
and told him about setting up his modem. The caller said impatiently, "Yeah,
yeah, I got it," and hung up. Later that day he called back, saying he had been
trying all day but could not get through to our lousy BBS. I checked but the
system had plenty of lines free. I asked him about his modem settings.  He
didn't have a modem. He had spent the day calling the BBS from his telephone.

We were having problems with one of our workstations -- it wasn't
communicating well over the LAN, and we kept getting ethernet timeouts.
We tried replacing the transceiver, but that didn't help, and we tried
shortening the network between that workstation and the next (we were on
the old thinnet lines then) but that didn't work either.  We'd even
recently installed a repeater to help with some of our LAN problems,
and <em>that</em> didn't work.
<em>I</em> knew what the problem was -- we'd had it before with one of out
other workstations.  It was a bad network chip in the workstation, and all we
had to do was call the DG Field Engineer, and he'd come replace the system
board and that would be that.  But my boss wouldn't do it.  It's not like it
was going to cost us anything, we had a flat fee maintenance contract, but
the guy just wouldn't call the FE and get it fixed, swearing that it was
something else and that we'd find it if we just kept looking.  So I was
sitting at my workstation, with my usual Incredible Hulk
GIF background, and we were working on the problem.  We tried something (I
don't remember what it was, now) and then tried to transfer a big file
from that workstation to the server.  And we started getting the usual
network timeouts.
<ul>
<li><b>Boss:</b> "Have you tried it without that background?"
</ul>
I gave him the most incredulous
look ever, and he just said, "Just humor me, will you?" and insisted I try
it.  So I did.  And of course, it didn't work.

Here's a silly incident which happened to me when I was trying to renew my
account in a local ISP in Malaysia.
I was trying to renew my account, and after consulting my computer dealer,
I had to do it through the bank. Two days after I sent the money, I checked
if my account was rebalanced and renewed. It wasn't.
My account had been terminated once last year -- I was not even
informed, and I only knew this after a ten minute session with technical
support. I wasn't enthusiastic about seeing another reoccurence, so I
sent a message to the ISP, stating, "I reviewed my account but it seemed
that it had not been updated yet. Please do it so as it may be an
inconvenience if my account is terminated without notice again like the
last time."
<p>
It may apparently be a simple request, but the ISP botched it.  They thought
I was asking them to terminate my account -- and send a notice about it.
I was given a notice politely telling me that my account would be terminated
within three days.
<p><hr><p>
I work at an ISP, primarily in tech support, but I
do sales sometimes. A woman called to sign up for Internet access a
few weeks ago. After taking some information, I asked her what she
wanted as her login name. She supplied me a name, which I checked in
the system, and replied, "I'm sorry, but that name has been taken. Try
something else."
<p>
The woman became very upset, insisting that she needed to use that
name and no other. I was curious enough to ask why, and the story came
out. It seems this lady had just purchased her computer, and it booted
into Windows 95 where it asked for a password to go with the login
she had supplied me.
<p>
After having tried numerous passwords, she finally decided that she
needed to sign up for Internet access so that we could supply her with a
password to login to her own computer!
<p>
Struggling to contain myself, I suggested that she tried pressing 'Cancel',
which would pop her right into Windows 95.  Once she realized she didn't need
a password after all, she hung up on me.

<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't log in to my account."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, let's look at your configuration."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok...but I know that my User ID is case sensitive."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Yes it is.  Ok, what does it say in the
 'User ID' field?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "'Case Sensitive'."

I was once discussing computers at a
party with a very snooty girl.  She was quite intoxicated and decided it
was time for a game of "I'm more intelligent than anyone else in the
room."  She started going off on a rant on how Microsoft Network was
much better than any other Internet provider.  Naturally, I asked why.
Her reply was (my paraphrasing):<p>
<ul>
<li> "During data transfers, both the transmitting and receiving computers
 usually are running on Windows 95, and by using MSN, you insure full
 compatibility throughout the transaction and thus can upload and
 download much faster than with any other provider."
</ul><p>
And furthermore,<p>
<ul>
<li> "I use only Microsoft apps at work and often want to download my files
 from my employer's network.  I can only use MSN because otherwise I
 would not be able to manipulate any of the downloaded files at home."
</ul><p>
As soon as the urge to ram her drink up her nose subsided, I excused
myself and kept at least ten people between us for the rest of the
evening.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Is there a place I can go in the computer to make the
 phone line better?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Some poor old lady called up because she was trying to answer the
questions in order to register with our service.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I'm sorry ma'am, but you'll have to register before
 using the service."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Really? Well, I tried. I mean, I answered all the
 questions. It was a little noisy but I answered all the questions."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Noisy? How could it be noisy? Your modem
 dialed, connected, and brought up the questions, right? Then what did you do?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I picked up the phone and answered everything on
 the screen.  There was a lot of static, but I figured they could still hear me."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't get any web pages."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, can you send and receive email?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, I can't."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, what kind of connection do you have with us?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "T1."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, what kind of router do you have?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Router?  I have no idea.  What's a router?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Would you happen to know the IP address of the router?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ummm, no...I don't know that kind of stuff."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is there anybody there that would know?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, the office is closed; I'm the only one here."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Then I'm sorry, I think you will have to have your
 network administrator call us."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I <em>am</em> the network administrator."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "And you don't know what kind of router you have?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, I never had to know that before; is your
 server down?"
</ul>
Draw circle. Bang head here.
<p><hr><p>
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  Someone here at work once asked,
eyeing the blinking lights on the transceiver next to him, "Do I have to wait
until the Ethernet is free before I can hit return to send my email?"
