<blockquote><h4>
This section contains some stories of silliness that don't fit anywhere else.

<p><hr><p>
Many people in computer labs will assure you, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that
they were doing everything correctly, and it still wasn't working, only to
make you get up from your nice comfy seat to walk over to the other side of
the room and do it yourself.  Invariably, after it works the first time for
you, the response is, "THAT'S WHAT I TYPED THE FIRST TIME!"  Obviously not.
<p><hr><p>
A customer, attempting to show that he's knowledgeable about computers...<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Do you know about MIDI?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(slightly puzzled)</em> "Yes..."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I was THERE."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
We have a customer here who recently bought his own domain.  His catch phrase
everytime he has a problem is, "Do you think I could add a MIDI file to fix
that?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I want to get the new Netscape from you people."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "I'll need to charge your account $30."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "What do you mean?  I pay for this service."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "We're providing the registered version of Netscape.
 Netscape charges us, so we have to charge you."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, my son is a socialist and I spent a year in
 Spain.  What do you have to say to that?"
</ul>
Uh....
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I thought so." <em>[click]</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hi, this is tech support. I was returning your support call."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Sorry, we don't sell lobsters to the public."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I have a friend who isn't very computer literate.  Whenever she saves
her work, she does it five times, one right after another, just to "make
sure it will actually be saved."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "All right...now double-click on the File Manager icon."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "That's why I hate this Windows -- because of the
 icons -- I'm a Protestant, and I don't believe in icons."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, that's just an industry term sir.  I don't
 believe it was meant to --"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't care about any 'Industry Terms'.  I don't
 believe in icons."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well...why don't you click on the 'little picture'
 of a file cabinet...is 'little picture' ok?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  <em>[click]</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Now click on the icon that--"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, I know what an icon is! That's that thing that
 Sandra Bullock clicked on in <em>The Net</em>!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Cut from our email support log:<p>

This morning I tried to sign on and for a purple screen.  After several
tried with different browsers then I got the message you were down.  I
tried to exit.  It went to a background with huge pixels and stuck.  I
mean no amount of rebooting would get rid of it.  Finally I had to reset
my wallpaper.
</kbd>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My disk is stuck in my disk drive. Clicking eject doesn't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, turn the power to your Mac off, hold down the
 mouse clicker, and power the Mac back up."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Look, I don't have three hands!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I was giving instructions to a caller once, but his son was the one physically
sitting at the computer, so all my instructions had to be relayed.  Here's
a snippet of the conversation:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Click on 'start', then select 'shut down', then select 'restart in MS-DOS mode'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(to his son)</em>  "Ok, press 'start', 'shut up', and 'sit down'!"
</ul><p>
The really scary part was what his son said then:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer's Son</b>:  "Ok, I'm at the C: prompt!"
</ul><p>
Do we really want to know what goes on at that house?
<p><hr><p>
Back to the days when I worked in technical support, I had a customer call
me with a problem.  I took his name and information, then asked him what the
problem was.  He got angry and started to yell at me, saying, "You should
know that by now."  When I told him that all I had was his username, password,
and phone number, he assumed I had connected to his computer via the Internet
and had complete and total access to his computer.  When I explained to him
that that wasn't possible, he was angered even more and said, "Then what the
hell am I paying you for!  This is technical support!  You're supposed to be
able to fix my computer!"  He hung up.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, we need to set up an icon for that program.
 To do that, I need to get you to your Program Mananger--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Program manager?  Why?!?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "I can't put an icon up for you to click on if you
 don't go to your Program Manager."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hell!  I don't even know who my immediate manager is,
 much less my program manager!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I did tech support for the now defunct Zelos Digital Learning.  We
published and produced CD-ROM educational multimedia titles.  One caller
asked if he could get a copy of our "3-D Tutor" software on floppy disks.
I told him the software would take up roughly 450 floppies' worth of space.
"So will you do it?" he asked.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li> "I don't need any of that SQL stuff -- I just want a database!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hi, I'm supposed to pack [zip] my database and send
 it to you. What should I pack it in?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
While working in tech support, I received a call from a user who asked me to
install some piece of software on her machine.  While installing,
there was a bit of a wait so I tried to make small talk.  I said, "This
machine is slow, isn't it?"  She replied, "Well, I have a friend who has
Quicken on her machine.  If I install it on this machine, will it run
faster?"
<p><hr><p>
At work, each employee has a home directory on a UNIX file system.  The
home directories are sorted into subdirectories, one per group within the
organization.  Recently I moved from one group to another and consequently
needed my UNIX account moved to the new area.
<p>
Finally I was informed that the move had taken place.  I logged in and
discovered that instead of copying the contents of my old home directory to
my new home directory, the copy started one level up.  So inside my new
home directory was actually a copy of the whole directory for my old group.
Basically I had a copy of <em>all</em> the home directories of all the members
of my old group right inside my new home directory.  (On top of that, my old
home directory was never removed from the old location.)  Fortunately, among
the many home directory copies I had was a copy of my own.  I fixed the problem
myself.  Good thing I'm a scrupulous person.
<p><hr><p>
A user came into my office this morning.  Apparently, her computer had
popped up a message that included the words, "See your System Administrator,"
so she came down to find out what I wanted.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I've been doing risk analysis by hand for five years,
 and we finally got your program so we could do it automatically --
 but there's a bug in it.  The answers come out differently each time."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, are you aware that our program uses
 Monte-Carlo analysis?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Of course I am. That's why I bought it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, do you know what Monte-Carlo analysis does?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Don't get rude with me, of course I do."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Put briefly, sir, it runs through your project
 several times, throwing random delays in, and at the end it averages out the results."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I know all that -- what I want to know is why it keeps
 giving me different answers every time I run it."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
When a colleague of mine first ran across
the original PKARC program (this was a while ago) he thought it was the
greatest thing. He figured that he could reduce each of his files to a
single byte by re-running PKARC on a .ARC file enough times.
<p>
I couldn't convince him otherwise because, lacking a detailed knowledge of
software compression techniques, I had only my own gut instinct to rely
on. That and the fact that, if he were correct, it would mean that the
number of possible different files was limited to 256.
<p><hr><p>
A guy I worked for was kind of a penny pincher. One of his disk space saving
techniques was to compress compressed compressions.  He would use the product
that compresses EXE files internally so they automatically expand when
executed, then zip a whole bunch of files including those, then store the
zip file on a DriveSpace compressed volume.  I think his eventual
goal was to get all his files down to 1 byte.
<p><hr><p>
I'm an occasional consultant for a group of lawyers who spend all day every 
day in Word and WordPerfect, completely ignoring the rest of Windows and 
other applications. One day the secretary called me and told me she was 
worried they were running out of disk space on the server and wanted to start 
saving space.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "How much disk space do you have left?" <em>(I told her how to find out.)</em>
<li><b>Her</b>: "6 gigabytes."
<li><b>Me</b>: "And how big is your collection of documents?" <em>(I told her
 how to find out.)</em>
<li><b>Her</b>: "8 megabytes."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Well, you're not going to run out of space for a long time,
 then. Why do you feel you need to save space?"
<li><b>Her</b>: "Because we work on these documents all day long, and I hear
 that I can make them smaller with WinZip."
</ul><p>
I told her all about archiving, zip, WinZip, etc. At her insistence, I helped 
her download and install WinZip. I walked her through the process of using 
the system, creating archives, decompressing them, etc. A week later she 
called again, in a panic.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Her</b>: "I zipped all of our files and deleted the originals, but
 all of the archives are corrupt!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Why do you think they're corrupt?"
<li><b>Her</b>: "Because when I open them in Word, all I see is garbage. When
 the boss finds out you told me to do this, he'll fire you and probably me too!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine had just found a working 386.  He said the end of the
monitor cable was missing a few pins, but he was going to fix it by
gluing new pins into the holes.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "When I boot up my computer, I get a NetBIOS
 error.  When is your server going to be back up?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I want a system that I can afford, but not one that
 will go obsolete in six or seven years."
</ul><p>
How about a time machine?
<p><hr><p>
I work as a lab proctor in a computer lab on campus. One day a gentleman
was having trouble editing his document, so I went over to his computer
to see what the problem was.  He was trying to type his paper in at
the DOS prompt.
<p><hr><p>
For some reason, all our classroom's computers' sound cards stopped
working. We determined that someone had deleted the sound drivers off all
the computers, so we told the teacher.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Students</b>: "Someone took the sound drivers off all the computers."
<li><b>Teacher</b>: "You mean they STOLE them??"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A while ago I was received a call from a woman who said that Eudora Pro
was showing her password.  I found this to be strange, because when you
type it in your password in Eudora, it displays asterisks.  So when I
went over to her office and looked at her desktop.  She had renamed the
Eudora Pro icon with her password.
<p><hr><p>
I provide tech support over the phones for a company.  We don't support
Windows 98 and usually refer Win 98 calls to the Microsoft tech support
line.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I have Windows 98 on my system, and there's something
 wrong with the number you guys gave me.  I can't seem to connect to it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What number did they give you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "1-800-426-9400.  My computer says there's no answer."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Your computer?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I am trying to connect using the setup wizard that
 keeps coming up, but everytime I dial out it tells me there's no
 answer.  There's something wrong with that phone number.  Could
 you give me a new one please?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, that number is not a BBS.  It's a toll-free
 voice number.  You have to use an actual phone."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "There's something wrong with that number."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Try using an actual PHONE.  <em>NOT</em> your
 computer.  Then see what you get."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "All right.  I'll give that a try.  But I doubt it'll work.  Thank you."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Recently, we upgraded all our users from WordPerfect 5.1 to 6.0.  One user was
so happy that she decided she'd never use WordPerfect 5.1 again.  So she went
into 5.1 and deleted all her files.  A short while later we got a call.
"I can't find any of my files!" she complained.  "What did you do with them?"
<p><hr><p>
One of my clients called one day saying that a bunch of her folders were
missing when she tried to open documents in Microsoft Word.  She was
smart enough to check trough Windows Explorer to see if the folders were
still present, which they were.  After several attempts over the phone to
find the missing folders my service manager decided to send me over
to take care of the problem.  When I arrived, I asked the lady to
duplicate the problem.  She started Word and clicked on 'Open'.  She then
pointed out that some of her Folders were there but not all of them.  As
politely as possible, I pointed out that the scroll bar on the bottom of
that window was not all the way to the left.  When she moved it
left, her missing folders appeared as expected.  Needless to say she was
very embarrassed since she had been using computers for over four years.
<p><hr><p>
I had a call from a user with a problem with his spell checker.  I walked him
through fixing the problem and later sent a follow up email, asking if the
problem was gone.
<p>
I got this back:<p>
<kbd>
Thanks for inquiring, the spell chicker works fine.
</kbd>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Hey. If I only want to print part of my spreadsheet,
 should I highlight the part I want to print and then click on the
 'Print Selection' button?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Uh, yeah."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok, great. I'll go try that." <em>[click]</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I once saw a person with a spreadsheet in front of him.  The spreadsheet had a
few lists of numbers, and he was adding them manually by punching them into
a calculator.
<p><hr><p>
During an Excel course:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Student</b>:  "What's the point of a spreadsheet?  All it can do is
 add things up and stuff."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
In our company, we use Lotus Notes as our database.  I am an executive
assistant and am involved with determining how to handle or solve problems our
field personnel have with the database.
<p>
One person was telling me that he had lost one of his databases.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Lost one of your databases?"
<li><b>Him</b>:  "Yes, it's fallen off my desktop."
</ul><p>
Apparently all he had done was rearrange his databases and only needed to
scroll down to find it.  Needless to say, I had been laughing the entire time.
<p><hr><p>
Before moving into network support, I did PC support for a large 
multinational utility company. We had bases all over the country and 
personnel moves were frequent. There was an software model in use 
consisting of applications delivered to the desktop using Novell 
Application Launcher. A user's ability to run or even see applications 
depended on membership of Netware groups.
<p>
One user had moved sites and had his account moved to a different 
container. The next Monday, he logged a call to the help desk, saying
that he couldn't see one of his applications any more.  Obviously
someone had just forgotten to add him to a group in his
new location.
<p>
My colleague received the following email from a help desk employee:<p>
<kbd>
Simon,<br>
This user has moved from Motherwell to Wrexham and has lost his 
Landmaster icon. Could it have fallen out of his PC when it was being moved?
</kbd>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I was wondering if this thing had a fan belt or something in it."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Sorry, a fan belt?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yeah, it's getting slower each time I start it in the
 morning, and I wondered if there was a fan belt or drive shaft that might be slipping."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A very irate dentist called to complain that the custom office package which
I had written was extremely slow.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Irate Dentist</b>: "It takes thirty minutes for the receptionist
 to enter an appointment!  This package is a piece of @#%$^!!  Come down here
 this afternoon and get it out of here!"
</ul><p>
I was able to calm him down and offered to rewrite any portion of the
software that wasn't executing correctly, which he finally agreed to.
That afternoon I sat with the receptionist to watch her use the software
and see where the slowdown occurred.
<p>
She began entering her first appointment:
<p>
S............... m............... i............... t..............
h............
<p>
I have never seen hunting and pecking go so agonizingly slow.  No wonder it
took thirty minutes to enter an appointment.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Oh, so you're running on a Mac?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I have a PowerMac, but I am running
 SoftWindows. It's just like Windows 95!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, find the <em>[ISP]</em> icon and right click on it."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "All right, this is where it is gonna get tricky...."
 <em>(then, to himself)</em> "What is that key command now?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I was helping my friend with her computer once.  I asked her to move a window
that was partially obscuring another.  I watched her as she resized the
overlying window by pulling the lower left corner way down, then resizing it
again by pulling the upper right corner so that it was the proper size
again.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Why did you do that?"
<li><b>Her</b>:  "Well I had to move it to see the other window, didn't I?"
</ul><p>
I showed her how to move windows around by the title bar, and she was amazed.
<p><hr><p>
I work for an online banking service as a sales and service support
representative. Part of our marketing included having our number on
customer's bank statements. Needless to say, we received many calls
unrelated to our service as customers would dial the first toll-free
number they saw on their statement. Most of the people who had called
in error quickly understood and were content to let us transfer them to
their local branch or just let us give them the correct number. One
elderly lady took some extra convincing, and after five minutes of
explaining that she had called the wrong area, reluctantly accepted my
offer of giving her the correct number.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Ok, the toll free number is 1 800..."
</ul><p>
I hear four telephone keypad tones come through my headset.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok, I have 1 800, what's the rest of the number?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Just one moment, I'm going to connect you directly."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Why didn't you tell me I have call waiting?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, we have no way of knowing if you have call waiting."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, you should ask everybody!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you have call waiting?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What's that?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
After dialing-in remotely to a field user's computer, I activated
PCAnywhere's chat window to communicate with the user since she didn't
have a dedicated phone line.  I typed, "Barbara, if you're there, just
type back."  After about ten seconds, my chat window started displaying,
"BACK" . . . "BACK" . . . "BACK" . . . "BACK"
<p><hr><p>
We sell an add-on for a popular flight simulation game.  A customer
called and was very concerned about the message telling her that she needed
a license in order to fly any of the planes in the game.  After a moment's
confusion I realized that she was referring to the license agreement that
comes with just about all commercial software.  I explained that no, we
just needed her to agree not to resell the product without a license.
<p>
What amazed me the most about the call was not that she had misunderstood
the license agreement, but that she'd actually read it in the first place.
I mean, who reads those things?
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Thank you for calling tech support, how may I help you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, is this the help desk?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes sir, it is; how may I help you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(in a very strained and excited voice)</em>
 "I can't go to the bathroom!"
</ul><p>
Understandably, I was shocked.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir...I am not sure what your definition of a
 help desk is, but I don't believe I am qualified to help you with that problem."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "You have to.  The nearest bathroom is broken, and the
 toilet is overflowing.  I don't know what to do.  Send someone up to repair it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, we only open do troubleshooting on computers,
 not bathrooms and toilets."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "But it's the same thing!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Um, no it's not."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It is too!  It's repairing things! Now I want someone
 up here right now."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "It's two entirely different things. Computers run
 on electricity and have hundreds of parts.  Toilets run on water."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It's an emergency!  Can you send someone up to fix it?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, might I suggest that you use another bathroom?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "AGH! I CAN'T USE ANOTHER BATHROOM! I HAVE TO GO NOW!
 GET SOMEONE UP HERE NOW!"
</ul><p>
I put him on hold.  For about three minutes.  I hate to be screamed at.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, I cannot. I have no way to do that. I fix
 computers. Not toilets."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(rant, rant, rave, rave)</em>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I'm sorry, I really can't help you."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh gosh...oh my pants!" <em>(click)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I work in the internal tech support department for our bank's
computers.  <em>Computers</em>, mind you.  Tech support for the
<em>computers</em>.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I have carpet people here and they are stretching my
 carpet and the iron they use is making smoke. How do I keep the smoke
 detectors from going off?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Several years ago, we had an intern who was none too swift.  One day he
was typing and said to a secretary, "I'm almost out of typing paper.
What do I do?"
<p>
"Just use copier machine paper," she told him.  With that, he took his last
remaining blank piece of paper, put it on the photocopier and proceeded to
make five blank copies.
<p><hr><p>
I once got an especially helpful reply to a question I asked on Microsoft's
on-line tech support service.  I wrote back to thank them for a complete and
concise reply and said how much I appreciated it.
<p>
The next day I had a response:
<kbd>
We are looking in to the problem and will contact
you with a solution as soon as possible.

One man complained that a message that appeared when installing Microsoft
Excel said that the installation would take thirty minutes...and it only
took ten.  This is the first time anyone has ever complained that the wait
was too short.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I had been waiting on the phone for you guys for three
 days!  So I finally decided to heck with it and did what the instructions said."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "My computer crashed!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "It crashed?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yeah, it won't let me play my game."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "All right, hit Control-Alt-Delete to reboot."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No, it didn't crash -- it crashed."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Huh?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I crashed my game.  That's what I said before.  Now it doesn't work."
</ul>
Turned out, the user was playing Lunar Lander and crashed his spaceship.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Click on 'File,' then 'New Game.'"

Someone needed help installing a game from a diskette.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Go to Start, Programs, MSDOS Prompt."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok..."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Now type 'cd\'."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, that can't be right."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Why not, ma'am?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Because it's not on a CD."

<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Can you teach me how to use a computer?"

I once saw a student type, "Please change my tutorial times," into a computer.
Surprise, surprise, it didn't work!
<p><hr><p>
A guy said whenever he typed the letter 'O', his Mac acted as though
he typed Command-O.  I told him I didn't think our INIT could do
that and suggested that maybe the Command key was stuck down.  He
replied, "****, this call is costing me money!"  He had a point, so
I asked how he found out our product was causing the problem.  He
said he did an automatic conflict resolution test with his startup
manager, which restarted his Mac five times in a row and
identified our INIT as the culprit.  Fair enough.  Did he attempt to
duplicate the problem after each startup?  No?  So how did the
startup manager know what it was looking for?  He said he told the
startup manager what the problem was by typing the words CORRUPT
KEYBOARD in the Notes field.  I tried to find a polite was to say
that startup managers don't read English yet, but it wasn't polite
enough to prevent a rebuttal composed entirely of cuss words.
Maybe if he'd typed <em>that</em> into his startup manager....

Since I teach nights at a local community college, I get a lot of
professional programmers in my classes upgrading their education.
One student, who was one such person, attended every lecture and smiled and
nodded and took notes.  But he only turned in his first assignment.
The results of his first test were horrid.  Out of curiosity, I asked my wife,
who barely knew how to turn a computer on much less program one, to take
the test (which was mostly true/false and multiple choice questions).  My
wife scored higher than this guy.
<p>
The semester's end came, and he flubbed his final, too.  A few weeks later,
I got a call from him complaining about his 'F'.  I pointed out he hadn't
turned in any of his assignments, and those counted 75% of the grade.
<p>
"Did you hear me say something besides what the other students heard?" I asked.
<p>
"Well, I thought my test grades would carry me," he replied.
<p>
It had turned out his company had paid for him to take the course.  Since he
failed, it suddenly came to the attention of his employer that he didn't know
how to program, and now his job was in jeopardy.  As I hung up the phone,
I mused that his company shouldn't fire him.  It was a perfect match:  a
programmer who couldn't program and a company that couldn't figure out sooner
that he couldn't.

During 12th grade, I read up a book called "Stupid Mac 
Tricks."  One of the tricks in it was how to replace the Mac's startup
screen.  As a joke, I made a graphic of a black-bordered white box with a
gray background.  The text in the box read, "This computer will self-destruct
in ten seconds.  Thank you, Apple Computer Co."  I made this the startup
screen for a computer in my high school's computer lab.
<p>
The next day an "out of order" sign was taped to the monitor.  The lab
attendants usually wrote the reason on the bottom edge of the paper, so I
leaned in to read what had been written there.  It said, "Will self-destruct."
<p><hr><p>
A call came in and the customer said that his computer was acting
funny.  The customer said that he shouldn't be having these
problems, because the computer was reading that it was "Ok."  The
tech pondered a moment, and came to the realization that the
display actually was "zero K" -- the customer's disk was full.

Back in the 1980s, my university had sponsered a "computer show" for various
vendors including IBM and Radio Shack.  IBM had just announced the IBM PC,
complete with dual low density floppy disks and standard 64K RAM, expandable
to 640K.  A very pretty blonde woman was operating the booth and was eager to
answer my every question.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "How much memory does it come with?"
<li><b>Her</b>: "Ummm, 64K."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "How much is an additional 64K memory?"
<li><b>Her</b>: "Extra memory is free."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Say what???"
<li><b>Her</b>: "Extra memory is free."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Is this the <em>IBM</em> booth?"
<li><b>Her</b>: "I know it sounds funny. Here, let me show you."

I am a tech for HP Calc support and I got a call last week from a lady
who wanted to send in her husband's calculator to be "overhauled."  When I
asked her what was wrong with it she replied, "Oh, nothing, it works fine; he

I guess she wanted the 10,000 calculation tune-up.

About six years ago I was starting to get into 4th Dimension (on the
Macintosh) and was setting up a multi-user database for a client.
I got everything setup as a single user system for the customer
because they didn't want to allocate resources to the database
until debugging was through, etc.  So, all was fine and dandy as
a single user system.  The customer called me back three days later and
was very frustrated trying to get multi-user working.  Everything
seemed ok in his setup, but he couldn't use both "machines" at
once because the other user kept "messing up the screen."  Turns
out that he just plugged two keyboards into the same Macintosh and
thought that meant multi-user.

she asked?  "Well," I explained, "that's the name of the author of

I heard this old story from someone who worked for a French company.  They
had a problem with a program on punched cards written for them by a US
subsidiary.  The programs never worked when loaded in France but the US
systems house swore blind that they did at their end.  Eventually, in
exasperation, someone followed the working set of cards from the US to France.
At French customs, he observed a customs official remove a few cards at
random from the deck.  Apparently, the French customs are entitled to remove
a sample from any bulk item (such as grain), so a few cards from a large
consignment shouldn't matter, should it?

A customer called a desktop publishing outfit and wanted a poster
made from a color slide.  It was a picture of the caller's recently
deceased father with a couple of his fishing buddies in a boat.
The caller mentioned there was a slight problem -- in the picture
her father was facing away from the camera.  She wanted the photo
expert to flip the negative so you could see his face.  When it was
explained that this would only provide a mirror image of the back
of his head she became irate and screamed into the phone, "If you
can take the pimples off those glamour girls why can't you put a

A few months ago a lady started to call our tech support department over

After exhausting the tech support pool, I was asked to see if I could help

into our 3D program.  After receiving the file I look at it and found that it
was a 2D DXF file.  I called this woman to inform her that she could not
import a 2D file.  She responded by screaming that she wanted her money

One customer kept reporting a problem with her system beeping at
her.  This would happen (at times) without a user at the computer
and at no specific times.  The random timing, of course, made the
troubleshooting difficult.  Our decision was to create a problem
report and have her call in when it was occurring or had occurred.
<p>
One month later, she called back.  It turned out that a pager had
been dropped under the desk where the computer was situated.
<p><hr><p>
I used to service bank teller workstations.  One day we received a call
that a workstation was beeping.  I took a look and couldn't find anything
wrong.  I cleaned the keyboard, just in case it was a stuck key.
<p>
The next day, she called back and complained that the computer was beeping
again.  This time I replaced the keyboard.  But the problem didn't go away --
she called back the next day.
<p>
I noticed that she called at the same time of day each day, so I asked if there
was something she did every day that might made the computer beep.  She said
there wasn't and that the computer would beep for about 15 seconds and then
stop.
<p>
The next day I happened to be in the bank for an unrelated issue.  At 3pm,
the beepin started, and I went over to track it down.  It seemed to be coming
from the keyboard until I looked a little further in the desk drawer.  There
was a digital alarm clock in there.
<p><hr><p>
My apartment-mate (we'll call him "Mike") sheepishly entered my
room, asking me if I could take a "look" at his computer.  He
rarely relies on my Mac expertise to solve a problem; he usually
takes it on as a "challenge" to solve it himself.  So I knew this
must be a stumper.
<p>
He turned on his Performa, and shortly after the extension parade,
his Mac started beeping.  Incessantly.
<p>
<em>Beep! Beep! Beep!</em>
<p>
We still had control of the Mac, and could open files, pull down
menus, etc.  But the incessant beeping was maddening.  We checked
every control panel for settings.  All seemed ok.  We changed the
error beep in the "Sounds" control panel, and lo and behold, the
incessant beeping became incessant quacking.
<p>
<em>Quack! Quack! Quack!</em>
<p>
Annoying, so we changed it back.  We lowered the volume in the
control panel, and now instead of beeping, the menu bar began
blinking (which is what normally happens when you mute the beep
sound).
<p>
<em>Blink! Blink! Blink!</em>
<p>
Obviously, first thing I tried was restarting with all extensions
off.
<p>
<em>Beep! Beep! Beep!</em>
<p>
So, what was going wrong with his Mac?  To what error was the Mac
trying to alert us?  And more importantly, was this a software or a
hardware problem?
<p>
Mike's first guess was to replace the system software (perhaps it
got corrupted?).  As he pulled out the old floppies, I figured I'd
test if this would solve the problem.  I started up from the System
Software CD-ROM that came with the computer.  Guess what?
<p>
<em>Beep! Beep! Beep!</em>
<p>
Just to be safe, I then started up from the Disk Tools.  Even
though it was a minimal system, with no control panels, we <em>STILL</em>
heard:
<p>
<em>Beep! Beep! Beep!</em>
<p>
No matter how we'd alter or re-install the software, this beeping
would not go away.  Perhaps a loose speaker connection?  Mike
finally admitted that he'd been pulling his hair for hours on this
one, and I was his last hope.  Apparently this incessant beeping
was plaguing him for three <em>days</em> now, and he could no longer
concentrate on getting his law studies done.  I could see the
psychosis building in his eyes.  This was a desperate man.
<p>
<em>Beep! Beep! Beep!</em>
<p>
I'd ascertained it was a hardware problem, which meant it was out
of my hands.  Before giving in completely, Mike seemed let down
that he'd actually have to bring his trusty, die-hard Mac in for
<em>service</em>.  Blasted Performas, I thought.  Apple probably cut some
corners to make the models less expensive.  Weird new features,
bundled software, ease-of-installation...I mean, how difficult is
it to install and configure a <em>real</em> Mac?
<p>
I began to exit the room.  Mike got on the phone.  Defeat.
<p>
<em>Beep! Beep! Beep!</em>
<p>
Then it hit me.  I turned around, headed back for the Performa.  At
the base of the CPU were two volume buttons to "ease"
adjustment...and the "up" button was jammed in.  With a quick
jiggle, it was released, and...
<p>
Silence.  Beautiful silence.
<p>
Mike asks me for Mac help all the time now.

One night my son was playing a computer game while I was watching TV.
I asked him to turn the sound down, and he did.  After a short while he
came over to watch TV with me.  Every so often I would hear the engine noise
of his game.  I asked him to turn off the game.  He did. I was still hearing
the noise and told at him to turn it off.  He said he had switched off the
power to the PC, but I was still hearing the engine noise about once a
minute.  We went over to look.  Sure enough, the computer was off, but the
sound was still there.  We unplugged the speakers.  Didn't help.  We pulled
out the batteries.  Didn't help.  Then I realized it was my pager that had
been sitting on one of the speakers.

I am a software installer for a large healthcare information systems company
that produces products for the AS/400.  On a recent install, shortly after
going live with the product, I needed to copy a new file to the live
environment.  In order to do this I needed to have all the users off the
system.  Rather than just shutting it down, I sent a message to all the
terminals that read, "Please sign off by 17.15.  If you do not sign off
voluntarily, your job will be terminated.  Thanks."  I sent the message and
about five minutes later, I received a call from the most irate ICU nurse I
have ever talked to.  She demanded to know who I was and who I worked for.
I explained to her that I was employed by the hospital to install their new
system.  She basically ranted and raved for a couple of minutes and told me
that my message was the most obnoxious and rude message she had ever read.
She then hung up on me.  I asked two of my colleagues to read the message and
both of them thought I was quite polite.  After all, I did say "please" and
"thank you."  I had the system down for about an hour and then brought it back
up.  I called the emergency room to make sure that the fix I had put in was
working.  The nurse informed me that it had but then asked me if she were
going to be fired.  "Excuse me", I said.  She asked again, "Am I going to be
fired?"  I told her I didn't know what she was talking about and then she
told me that she wasn't the only one worried.  She then explained she had
been on the system when it was taken down and she thought that meant
losing her job!  I couldn't believe it.  I explained to her that the term "job"
was a computer term meaning the program you were currently in.  It
suddenly dawned on me why the ICU nurse had been so rude and why, I
found out later, the nursing supervisor and the head of Information Systems
had been beeped!  I send out a message over the system apologizing.  The next
morning, I ran into the CEO and CFO of the hospital who thought the
whole thing was hilarious and took to calling me the Terminator.  They told
me that anyone that stupid deserved to be fired.

I took Fractint in to the computer lab at my high school ('286's, VGA, mongo

<li><b>Me:</b>  "Sure, the documentation is right here."
<li><b>Her:</b>  "Where?"
<li><b>Me:</b>  "On this disk."
<li><b>Her:</b>  "I told you, I can't put copywritten software on our computers!"
<li><b>Me:</b>  "I'm not putting software; I'm just putting a text file.  See,
 I can't show you the program because it's packed--"
<li><b>Her:</b>  "Look, if you can download a hard copy of the proof..."
<li><b>Me:</b>  "Download a <em>hard copy</em>?  HUH?"
<li><b>Her:</b>  "Well, print it out!"
<li><b>Me:</b>  "Look, there's a printer right here!  I can just--"
<li><b>Her:</b>  "NO COPYWRITTEN SOFTWARE!"
<li><b>Me:</b>  "It's public domain!  I got it straight from the authors over a network!"
<li><b>Her:</b>  "Just because it's on a network doesn't mean it's public domain!"

I once read a short story where the villain sent email to the goodguys, in
which he gloats about his escape.  He tells all about his evil plan and says
that money must be deposited in his bank account by clicking on a
"deposit-only" icon (which consisted of three ASCII symbols embedded in the
email message).  He then went on to say that the email message itself couldn't
be used as evidence, because it was self-destructed by an "auto delete"
feature "triggered simply by accessing these last two paragraphs."

Once I helped a user whose folders were all named "New Folder."  There was
a "New Folder" and a "New Folder (2)" and so on up to "New Folder (35)."  He
opened up one of them, and there were more "New Folders."  And inside those
were more.  He had a series of handwritten sheets that indexed each of his
files for him.  He'd look up a file he wanted to find, and it would say, for
example, "New Folder (22) - New Folder (5) - New Folder (8)."
<p>
I mentioned that he could rename the folders to reflect what data they
contained.  The user thanked me but assured me that the system he was currently
using worked quite well.

I live in Italy.  I'm sort of knowledgeable with computers, so friends and
relations often come to me when they have a problem. One day, my
brother-in-law told me his brother's laptop wouldn't work anymore and asked
if I can help.
<p>
He drove over one day and came into my office with the laptop.  He told me
the machine hadn't been able to boot for the last three days, though it worked
perfectly before then.  I switched it on, and it started going.  Then it
froze.  I told him there's probably some corrupted driver, and the first thing
to do is back up his documents.  I booted from a floppy and checked his folders.
When I looked into the Windows directory, I noticed a bunch of files named
"A," "B," "C," "1," "2," and so on -- and a few Italian translations of
original file names, like FINESTRE.EXE instead of WINDOWS.EXE.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Why on earth did you do this?"

 that if you clicked on a filename you could rename it. So I did.

An executive secretary, who was a beginning computer user learning
on a PC clone, got lazy about naming her files.  Instead of using
descriptive file names to name her files, she started her own
system.  She numbered the files (1, 2, 3, etc) and kept a notebook
listing the file number and file description.  This system worked
well enough for her, getting her up to over file #5000.  And it
would have continued to work for her had disaster not struck -- she
lost the notebook.  Each and every file had to be opened and
renamed.  Luckily for her, she was an executive's secretary who had
been there forever, so her job was safe.

A user once wrote in to demand that we (an ISP) switch servers from a
SparcStation costing as much as a small house to a "superior" $5000 Win 95
machine, or he and all his friends would quit.  His letter closed with the
line, "Don't fight me on this. I never lose." He lost.

I work at a University's computer cluster.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Student</b>: "I have a picture on my computer at home that I
 want to load into Wordperfect here, but it says that it's an unknown file format."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "It needs to be BMP, TIF or WordPerfect Graphic
 for WordPerfect to be able to use it."
<li><b>Student</b>: "Oh, ok, no problem, I'll bring in the BMP version."
</ul><p>
The next day the student came in with the JPEG file, renamed to have a .BMP
extension.

I once had a computer science professor who couldn't understand how overhead
projectors worked, despite her many years of teaching experience.  One day
she discovered that the focus knob made the viewing area on the screen
bigger or smaller.  Then she put a transparency on the thing, and I could
scarcely contain myself when I witnessed her trying to adjust it.
<p>
She'd look back at the screen and use the focus knob to focus it properly.
Then, when it was, she'd turn back to the projector and crank <em>the same
knob</em> in order to make the viewing area bigger -- naturally throwing it
all out of focus.  Then she'd turn back to the board, realize it was out of
focus, then adjust the focus with the focus knob (aided by the students, who
had started to offer verbal advice -- "a little more," "too far," "right
there," and so on).  Then, the focus fine-tuned, she'd turn back again and
crank the focus knob a bunch of times to make the image bigger.  She did this
probably three times before she realized that making the image bigger also
meant throwing it out of focus.  I don't know why it didn't register that
what she was doing didn't make an ounce of sense.<p>

A co-worker once thought he was being electrocuted when his new beeper was
set to vibrate, and he was fixing his reading lamp when it went off. This
same person accidentally shot himself in the foot while he was being strangled
by his rental car's automatic seatbelt. It was on his honeymoon -- he was
returning the vehicle to the drop-off and was unloading his pistol en route.
(A story in itself.)  He was too far away from the ticket machine and
couldn't back up because he had already driven over the spikes.  He had
his pistol in one hand, still loaded, and opened the door to get his ticket.
The automatic seatbelt did it's thing. It pushed him to the floor and
somehow wrapped itself around his neck when he closed the door. It began to
strangle him, and while he was trying to reach the emergency release, the gun
went off, putting a hole in his shoe, his foot, and the floor board.

I write HTML. My supervisor asked me to modify an imagemap so that a
formerly inactive link could become active. Studying the positions of the
links above and below it in the image, I added a rectangle area to the
imagemap.  She was greatly impressed and asked how I knew which numbers to
enter.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Oh, they're the coordinates of the pixels."
<li><b>My Supervisor</b>:  "Coordinates?  What do you mean?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "You know. Like in geometry, when you say something is at
 5,4. Or like in Battleship, except with two numbers instead of a
 number and a letter."
<li><b>My Supervisor</b>:  "I don't know what you mean."
</ul><p>
Twenty minutes later, I was still explaining the basics of Cartesian
geometry.

Once I worked as an operator on an old IBM 370/Model 138 mainframe at a local
college.  My position had been reclassified to fall into a new area outside
of the I/S staff.  One day, my new supervisor entered the room and stared at
the air conditioning unit directly behind me.  He studied the two flashing
lights for a few moments and asked what job it was currently processing.  I
killed my career by replying, "Actually, sir, it's cooling the room.  The
computer is over here."

<em>Submitted from a completely different reader is this reversal of the above
anecdote:</em><p>
A Sun server in a tall rack-mount cabinet was
installed in an early 19th-century building in the only available place:
the corner of a conference room.  A distinguished faculty member was
ushered into the conference room one day, where he would grade some tests,
read some applications, or something of that sort.  After a while the server
crashed.  When the techies went into the conference room, Professor X
explained, "It got cold in here, so I turned off the air conditioner."

I got a call from an angry customer who complained that we had sold him a
dead computer because his computer wouldn't start up.  Come to find out, he
had been trying to start it with the keyboard lock keys...like a car.

<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I got that there version 3.1 of your program and it
 don't run on my Macintosh 7500."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes sir.  That is correct.  3.1 is not compatible
 with the PCI Power PC Macs.  You need version 5.0 or later."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yep -- I got me one of them version 5's too!  It runs
 fine! Right quick too!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well sir, you have the upgrade, so what's the problem?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, I just want to know when you're gonna make the
 3.1 version run on Power PCs, 'cuz we've been using the 3.1
 version years more than the 5.0, and we like it just fine."
