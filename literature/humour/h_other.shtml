These days, you can get all kinds of add-on devices for your computer that
perform all manner of different tasks.  With such a diversity of equipment,
it's all the harder for new users to keep up.

<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Your sound card is defective and I want a new one."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What seems to be the problem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "The balance is backwards. The left channel is coming
 out of the right speaker and the right channel is coming out the left.
 It's defective.
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You can solve the problem by moving the left
 speaker the right side of the machine and vice versa."
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(sputter) (click)</em>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(snicker)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'd like to return this scanner."
<li><b>Store Clerk</b>: "Excuse me?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "This scanner I bought.  I paid eighty dollars for this
 scanner, and it doesn't work!"
<li><b>Store Clerk</b>: "Uh...sir, that's a trackball."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, it isn't. It says 600 dpi tracking resolution right here!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One night I was watching QVC, and the current item being
displayed was a computer.  Someone who had just bought one called
in and was put on the air.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hi, I bought that Kodak scanner you had on, and
 whenever I scan a photo into the computer I have now, it's 25 megs.  How
 do I make it a sendable file size for email?"
<li><b>Host</b>:  "Well, with that 56K modem, the size won't matter because
 of the speed."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I was at an ad agency a while back and there was a big project deadline
looming.  The folks who were printing this particular ad were about 150
miles away and had to get all of the files that the agency had put together
in a hurry.  We found out the hard way, after trial and error, that the
print house didn't have any Internet access at all, so we couldn't email the
data.  So I suggested that we meet half way, and I'd give them the files on
a zip disk.  I asked the woman on the phone if she had a zip.  She replied
with a five digit number.
<p><hr><p>
A customer was trying to open a .zip file in PowerPoint.  She was getting the
error message, "This is not a PowerPoint presentation.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You need to unzip the file first before
 PowerPoint can open it."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "But I put it on a zip disk.  Doesn't that do it?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I bought your fancy graphics card, and my Windows
 display is no better than it was before."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "We had better look at the installation then."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "You mean I have to install it?"
</ul>
The graphics card was still in the box.
<p><hr><p>
I recently purchased a Sony Mavica still camera, which, for those
unfamiliar, is a digital camera that stores snapshots on a floppy disk.
Twice so far I have had someone ask me if it is safe to take the disk
out in a lighted room.
<p><hr><p>
A client called in with computer problems.  Part of the conversation went like
this:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "...I'm an educated man, so don't you dare talk down to me!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, sir.  Do you have a desktop or tower case?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Don't use that technical !&amp;#$@!* with me!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>A Friend</b>: "Do you have a Soundblaster in your computer?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "No, I have a GUS MAX."
<li><b>A Friend</b>: "A what?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "You know a Gravis Ultrasound MAX card."
<li><b>A Friend</b>: "Yeah, that's right, like I told you. You have a Soundblaster."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I was at a classmate's house once, explaining some things to her about
Internet communications and about ICQ and Netmeeting and so forth.  She asked
me if she could download Netmeeting from the Internet, and I said she could
but that she would need a microphone for the talking part.  She stared at
me with the most naive look and asked if she could download the microphone,
too.
<p><hr><p>
A customer called in.  After pulling up his case, I realized that this was
his fifth call to us over the last two days, all regarding the same product.
He was trying to add a 3D accelerator card to his system and could not get it
to work.  He had spoken to us four times and to his computer manufacturer
twice.  It was still not functional.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I hope you can help me out. I have made several calls
 now and cannot fix this problem."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, I'll see what I can do.  So, I am seeing
 here that the card is not being detected by your computer. Is that right?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Correct. When I boot up, Windows never detects the card.
 Previous techs had me run the 'Add New Hardware' wizard, and we checked
 the device manager, but there wasn't anything there."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok.  Have you tried putting the card into another slot?"
<li> <b>Customer</b>: "What do you mean?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, if for some reason the system does not see
 the card in this slot, perhaps putting the card in another slot will help."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "How do I do that?  Do I have to take it apart?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, you will have to take the case off."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok, just a second....  Ok, the case is off now."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Do you have any more PCI slots free?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I am not sure."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "How many PCI slots do you have in your system?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Umm...eight."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You have eight PCI slots in your system?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "How many white PCI slots do you have?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ummm...five."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok.  Of those five, how many have something in them?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "One."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "One?  And is this the accelerator card?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No.  Oh hey, is that card I got supposed to fit into
 one of these slots?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, that's the idea.  Where is the accelerator
 card currently?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, it comes with that small black cable, so I have
 it on the outside of the computer, hooked up with that cable you sent with it."
</ul><p>
I walked him through the install process, and everything was fine.  This was
his seventh call to some form of support, and the card never even made it into
the computer.  Sigh.
<p><hr><p>
A customer called up the company that made her hand-held scanner,
complaining that it wasn't scanning correctly.  After several
minutes of hardware and software questions, the tech asked what
exactly the person did to scan.  "Well," she said, "I simply put it
on the side of my head and drag it down."  (And she wonders why the
"brain scanner" can't find anything!)
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What kind of ink cartidges do I need for this scanner?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "The scanner you installed seems to work, but
 whenever I scan a photo, there's a wide black border. Any way to get
 rid of this?"
</ul><p>
I looked at the program he was using. It was a very primitive one that
doesn't let you preview the image before scanning.  So I showed him how to cut
the black borders once he scanned in the picture.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "But while scanning, the picture still has that
 thick black border, and it's using up my printer ink!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I was working for a computer education company, setting up the classes.
One week we were training for Cisco routers.  To do this, another training
company sent us six routers in two cargo boxes locked with combination locks.
The sheet of paper with the combinations was shipped securely inside.
<p><hr><p>
I work with someone who has very, very little real computer experience.
He was one of the first people in the office to get a PC (most of us had
UNIX machines before), and the first thing he did was delete everything
he didn't want -- things like the networking software he needs to connect
to our network.
<p>
Some time ago, his Jaz drive broke.  I told him it was broken and that he
should use his office charge card to buy a new one and then I'd install it
for him.  He bought a new one.  He spent the better part of two weeks trying
to install it himself.  It took him that long to figure out he didn't have
the right SCSI adapter in his computer.  (I had scavenged the Jaz card from
his system after the old one broke, and I had told him that he'd need a new
Jaz card, too -- but he didn't believe me.)
<p>
After finally realizing he needed a new card, he bought one, installed it,
and tried again.  It still didn't work.  He wracked his brain.  He emailed
me:<p>
<blockquote>
"My jazz drive still isn't quite right and I wanted to ask you a question
about it. In the beginning of pentium time, we purchased this
machine before we had Nt, correct? So, was this jazz drive installed
initially with win95 software? And then when we went to NT, did you have
to run the NT software for Jazz on my machine or am i still running win95
alone (i doubt that)(doesn't make sense to me)? Please help me get with
the program here..."
</blockquote><p>
His machine is running Windows 95.  It has always been running Windows 95.
The NT machines he refers to were all purchased later.  He still, to this day,
and no matter what I say otherwise, thinks that somehow the act of networking
his computer turned it into something else.  He talks about the difference
between "stand alone" and "networked" computers all the time, as if there was
some mystical difference between the two, something other than the fact that
one has networking software installed and the other doesn't.<p>
As far as I know, he's still trying to get that Jaz drive to work.
