<H3>6.2 Stupid Salesmen</H3>
<blockquote><h4>
There are some salesmen out there who are content to remain blissfully ignorant
about the products they're selling.
</h4></blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
A friend and I were looking for a C compiler in a software store.  We went in
and searched the shelves but found nothing.  We asked the salesperson.  He
went looking through the games section.  I told him it was a programming
language.  So he took us to the foreign language software.
<p><hr><p>
The other day I walked into this little place that sells old software, old
computers, and some new software. I walked
up to a sales clerk and said, "Do you guys carry Linux?" He took one look
at me (I am 15 years old) and, not knowing what Linux was, he checked the rack
with games. I said, "No, Linux is not a game -- it's an operating
system."
<p>
He looked confused, then stuttered, "Uhhh...yeah...well check that rack,
we've got stuff like Quicken there."
<p><hr><p>
One day I received a catalogue from a mail order company.  I tried to find
Linux.  It took me a while.  It was in the games section.
<p><hr><p>
A few years ago I visited a computer store and saw a computer equipped
with this new Microid Research BIOS which was unfamiliar to me. I would
like to know something about the performance of this BIOS, so I asked if
it was a fast BIOS. "Well yes!" he answered, "Take a look at this!" He
rebooted the computer and pointed at the "Press DEL to enter SETUP"
message, which was on the screen for five seconds. Then he rebooted the
system again, entered the BIOS, and decreased the "Display enter setup
message time" from five seconds to one second, left the BIOS, and rebooted
the system once more. While it was booting, he pointed again at the "Press DEL
to enter SETUP" message which was now on the screen for just one second.
"See how fast it is?" he said proudly.  "I increased its speed by a factor
of five!  Is this a fast BIOS or what?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'd like to sign up for your Internet service."
<li><b>Sales</b>: "Do you have Internet access?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Sales</b>: "Then you can use our signup form at <em>[address]</em>."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm there right now, and it doesn't look like it's a secure form."
<li><b>Sales</b>: "Oh, it's secure. I can almost guarantee you that it's secure."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "But I'm there right now, and it's not."
<li><b>Sales</b>: "It's secure. Only one lady looks at it."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I once went to our local computer store, known for the stupidity of its
employees. I decided to test the rumors, so I asked which joystick was
better, the normal Microsoft Sidewinder, or the Force Feedback
Sidewinder.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "The normal one. The other one feels rather shaky."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "Yes, you can record DVD movies on this 32X cdrom
 drive, as long as you use DIVX disks."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "OS/2 Warp...that's a game, isn't it?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A friend and I visited a computer store in a mall.  They had aisles of
software and cabinets of hardware in the back.  I was curious to know
how much they charged for RAM, so we headed for the rear of the store.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "May I help you, ladies?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Sure.  We'd like to see how much your RAM is."
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  <em>(looking around uncertainly)</em>  "Let's look over
 here.  Is this for a Mac or PC?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "PC.  I have an HP."
</ul><p>
Suddenly the salesman turns down a software aisle.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "That sounds like a war game.  It should be along in here
 if we have it."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Uhhhhhhhh...we're looking for RAM.  You know, computer
 memory.  Not software."
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "Oh!  Memory!  That would be over in the children's section."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I once asked a salesman in a computer store about a monitor I was interested
in buying.
<ul>
<li><b>Me:</b>  "Is it interlaced?"
<li><b>Salesman:</b>  "Oh, it's fully interlaced."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I went into a "Software Etc." store at the mall just after Quake came
out to look for a demo CD. When I got it, the salesman was telling
me about one of those CDs with Quake levels. Since the game had
just come out, it was obviously one of those cheap CDs where they
just download all the levels off ftp.cdrom.com and burn it to a CD.
<p>
But the sales guy told me that it was the only one that
is approved by Id Software. However, no Id Software logo, seal, or
note of approval was found on the box.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Are you sure this isn't one of those things where they
 just download levels off the net and throw them onto a CD?"
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "Uh...no.  In fact, the guys at Id Software hacked
 into those FTP sites and put VIRUSES in the levels!!!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
It was 1995. I was a freshman in college.  I'd just
gone to the computer labs for the first time to get
signed up for an account on the campus network. The
tech support guy I talked to wanted the specs on my
machine, so I told him.  At the time, I had a 28.8
modem.  He told me I must be mistaken.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Why?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "They don't make 28.8 modems. The phone
 lines can't support them."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Uhhh.  I ran a BBS for four years back home and helped
 over 200 people get their modems set up.  I know what I'm doing with
 modems, and I promise you I have a 28.8."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Nope. You must be mistaken. 2400 is the
 fastest modem available today."
<li><b>Me</b>: "No, that was six years ago.  The modems are faster now."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Why would they make modems faster? It's
 not like the phone lines can support anything faster
 than 2400 in the first place."
</ul><p>
At this point, I just gave up and walked out.  I went
back to my dorm, grabbed the modem's box, which I
had used to transport some electronic gadgets, and
brought it back to the tech guy. I brought my friend
along because I figured he'd be entertained by all
this.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Hi, it's me again.  I just thought I'd show you
 this box, which clearly states that it's a 28.8 modem."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Oh, that's a ZOOM modem.  Well, ZOOM is
 widely known in the industry for lying about the
 capabilities of their modems.  It's a 2400, but they
 say it's a 28.8 so people will buy it instead of a
 Hayes, which is the only good modem out there."
</ul><p>
At this point, several people, including my friend,
were laughing at this moron.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: <em>(to others in the room)</em> "Say, what's the
 fastest speed of modem out there?"
<li><b>Everyone</b>: "28.8!"
</ul><p>
The tech support guy got mad and suggested that we all
enroll in the "Introduction to Computers" seminar they
were offering.  
<p><hr><p>
I was channel surfing the other night when I came across this guy on QVC
giving a demo of Windows on a ThinkPad 500. After a few choice comments from
the slick salesman, I started taking notes.
<p>
He started out by explaining that icons were like glimpses of what was
behind them and proceeded to show the Accessories "menu." He talked about
how wonderful this deal was since the machine came with so much preloaded
software, and then gave a brief description of each icon in Accessories.
First there was "A-Write" the "word processing package" (I think he called
it "A-Write" because the icon for Write has a fountain pen drawing an 'A'.)
Then there was Paintbrush, which allows you to "do your 3D work," he said.
"For example, if you were designing a house, you could keep all the floor
plans and layouts in here."
<p>
Next was Terminal, "which lets you uhhh, uhhhh, add another uhh, terminal to
your computer." He fumbled a little more and skipped Notepad, presumably
because he couldn't make up anything good to say just after describing
"A-Write." Next: "It has this Recorder, which helps you be a little like Steven
Spielberg...it interfaces directly with your VHS cassettes."
While pointing at the next icon he proudly announced that the machine even
came with a built-in Clock.
<p>
There was Calculator, which of course "manages your finances."
He mentioned some of the "executive" features, like Calendar and Cardfile.
He pretty much gave up at Object Packager, but saved the moment by kicking
into a demo of the "word processing package" because, "If you're like me,
that's where your family will spend most of its time."
<p>
In his "A-Write" demo, he drooled about how versatile the software was.
(Somehow the common font picker dialog just didn't convince me to pick up
the phone and order a ThinkPad.) As proof of how useful the "word processing
package" was, he "printed in" a sentence: "Dean shows hot computers on QVC."
Then "Oh jeez!" he exclaimed, "It's been a long day folks, I misspelled my
own first name!" (Dan) He proceeded to hit the backspace key 31 TIMES,
leaving only the 'D'. He started retyping the rest of the sentence but gave
up midway and moved on. "Let me tell you something: This thing will really
change your life!"
<p>
He started babbling about "executive" features again and fired up the
Cardfile "database system." It kind of took the punch out when the camera
zoomed back in, and you saw that there were three dessert recipes on the
screen.
<p>
The stupidity went on, but mostly on other bundled things like "C-Mail" (I
think he meant 'Lotus Cc:Mail') and some IBM antivirus utilities.
<p>
An interesting note: In one screen shot it was evident that IBM had replaced
the MS-DOS icon with a PC-DOS icon that looks almost identical to the OS/2
logo. Later on, while showing off the manuals, he held up the clearly
labelled "IBM PC-DOS" book and said, "You get an MS-DOS manual...."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Is this modem V.90 standard?"
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "V.90 standard? You don't need it. There's no ISP which has that."
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(frowning)</em> "Does the motherboard have a BX chipset?"
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "BX chipset? Not important. It's much more important
 that is has a Pentium II."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Does it have a 2D or a 3D graphics card?"
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "I don't know. I'll go check."
</ul>
After a while...<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "No, it can't run on a TV."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "Can I help you?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Yes...I'm looking at this Compaq here. Do you have any of these in stock?"
</ul><p>
He leads me to his terminal. There is much typing.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "No, but we do have this other model. It's got a
 Pentium, so it's better."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Um...I was looking at a 400 Mhz. This one is a 300. And it
 only has half the RAM."
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "Yes, but it's a Pentium, so it's better. Look, it
 has a DVD drive, too."
</ul><p>
He puts in <em>Armageddon</em> and turns up the volume to a ludicrous level.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "The one I wanted had a third generation DVD drive. This
 is a first generation one."
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "Yes, but it's a Pentium, so it's better."
</ul><p>
He turns up the volume the rest of the way. People nearby start giving us
dirty looks.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "I'd like some more time to think about this."
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "Ok."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
At a rather large electronics chain I was looking at the new 3D
accelerators with a friend of mine.  A salesman overheard me and piped up.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "The newest are the OpenGL cards. They make 3D
 accelerators obsolete!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Overheard in a computer store:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "What does MMX mean?"
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "It means you don't need a sound card anymore."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I was in a computer store, waiting in line at customer
service. I overheard this, between a customer and the sales clerk:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "What's the difference between a SCSI scanner and a
 parallel port scanner?"
<li><b>Sales Clerk</b>:  "Well, SCSI has 50 pins, and parallel only has
 25, so it's twice as fast."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Once a salesperson told me that Windows 95 was only for desktop computers
and that I'd need to buy Windows CE for my laptop.
<p><hr><p>
After comparing feature lists and sample print-outs from several printers, I
finally decided to buy a certain model.  I flagged down a salesman and as
we went to one of the "sales" desks, he continued to tell me about
additional wonderful features of this printer and how top-of-the-line and
reliable it was.
<p>
Finally, before completing the sale, he asked me if I wanted to purchase a
service agreement, saying that I really ought to buy one, since printers are
prone to all sorts of problems and breakdowns and may have a 50 percent
out-of-the-box failure rate.
<p>
"Wait," I asked him, "you just told me how high-quality and reliable this
printer is.  Are you saying it really <em>isn't</em> that good after all?"
<p>
He didn't really have an answer for that and didn't mention the service
agreement again.
<p><hr><p>
Once my father asked a computer salesman about the interior of a hard disk.
The salesman replied, "It's not really a disk -- it's just a piece of
electronics that's called a disk because you save things on it."
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine needed to upgrade his 386 with some new memory (this was a
while ago).  At that time, there were two basic types of memory -- 30 pin
and 72 pin.  He went into a computer store and asked about the memory they
had on display.  He picked up a box containing a 72 pin SIMM, but the
salesman stopped him.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "That's a 30 pin SIMM.  You said you needed a 72 pin, right?"
<li><b>My Friend</b>:  "Um, this has 72 pins."
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "No, that's a 30 pin."
<li><b>My Friend</b>:  <em>(quietly amused, looking at the connectors on the
 board)</em> "Well, it certainly looks like there's 72 connectors there."
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "Oh that has nothing to do with it."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
My dad -- a man of admirable common sense for a computer newbie -- leaped
from editing to managing desktop publishing to selling computers.  Once he
had to train a new salesperson who claimed a degree in computer science.
According to her, there wasn't anything she didn't know.  At the start of
teaching her about some software their (very big) company was selling, he
told her to use the mouse to click on something on the screen.  In all
seriousness, she picked up the mouse and physically pressed the end of it
to the screen.  Urban legends abound about stupid computer users, but this
woman embodied them.  She once attempted scanning by placing a
document against the computer screen.  Ultimately, she was fired for
incompetence (imagine!) but as expected, she blamed everyone else.
<p><hr><p>
I'm a technician in a small computer store in New York.
One day, a particularly distraught man brought his computer in and complained
that it kept freezing.  I did the usual checks but couldn't find anything.
Since he had just bought it the day before, I authorized a replacement but
told him he'd have to wait an hour for us to configure the machine properly.
<p>
He was very upset at having to wait, so he complained to his salesperson, who
has no control or responsibility over the tech department.  He came storming
in, all upset and fearing the loss of his commission.  He laid into me, asking
why I couldn't just fix the problem (it would have taken longer), and I just
kept pointing out how his silly arguing was cutting into the time I could
have spent setting up the new computer.
<p>
At any rate, the customer eventually walked over and asked the salesperson
what was wrong with the machine -- he was quite upset that his brand new
computer didn't work and that he didn't know why.  The salesperson cracked
a wide smile.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "Relax. The BIOS on the sound card was conflicting
 with the AOL drivers.  This caused a problem with your memory,
 making the machine reboot."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "But it wasn't rebooting -- it was freezing."
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "Yeah, well, that too."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I went into a store to purchase an external modem for one of my customers.
He had an older system and the fastest modem that he could use was a 33.6.
The salesman insisted that the slowest external modem ever manufactured was
56K.  There was not and had never been a 33.6 modem.  I pointed out a
label on the shelf that said, "33.6 External Modem," and he insisted that it
was a misprint.  There were boxes on the back shelf that were clearly what I
wanted.  He <em>refused</em> to sell me one.  Losing a sale was apparently
preferable to admitting an error.
<p><hr><p>
In late 1995, I called a large computer software/hardware chain notorious
for their lack of service and asked them if they had any copies of Windows 95
in stock.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "No, that hasn't been invented yet."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "What?  I have a copy of Windows 95 in my hand."
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "No, that hasn't been invented yet."
<li><b>Me</b>:  <em>(very slowly)</em>  "I H-A-V-E A C-O-P-Y I-N M-Y H-A-N-D R-I-G-H-T N-O-W."
<li><b>Salesman</b>:  "That can't be.  It hasn't been invented yet."
</ul><p>
I hung up and called a smaller dealer.  They were more than happy to put a
copy aside for me.
