<blockquote><h4>
In the frustrating calls department are the people who insist they know
more about computers than the tech support personnel and calls from people
who refuse to do what they are told.

<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Sir, I need you to click <em>once</em> on your
 America Online icon."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok..."
</ul>
<em>clicka..clicka..clicka..clicka..clicka..clicka..clicka..clicka</em>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Uh, 'invalid path'."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, can you click on the icon ONE time for me?"
</ul>
<em>clicka..clicka..clicka..clicka..clicka..clicka..clicka..clicka</em>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Icon still says 'invalid path'."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Could you PLEASE CLICK ONE TIME, and ONLY ONE
 TIME, on the America Online icon?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Uh, just one time?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "YES."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, now click on that icon."
</ul>
Repeated taps of the spacebar resound.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  <em>[thickly accented]</em>  "It not wolking."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, no.  Use the button on the mouse, not the
 spacebar."
</ul>
Tap, tap, tap goes the spacebar.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It not wolking!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Now I want you to click the right mouse button
 over the <em>[ISP]</em> icon."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yep."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did a menu appear with 'Properties' being listed
 at the bottom?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No! It just says <em>[ISP]</em>, and there's two
 buttons, 'Connect' and 'Cancel'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, let's just try again. You must have double
 clicked using the left mouse button. No problem, just click 'Cancel'.
 Now, I'd like you to click the button on the right of the mouse, not
 the left, and I'd like you to click it only once."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Now it says 'Create Shortcut Here'!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, click on 'Cancel'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Left or right button?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Left, please."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Now what?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, let's just try this again."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "All right then, one last time."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Right, ok, please click the right mouse button
 over <em>[ISP]</em> and please try and keep the mouse still when doing so."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Which button is the left button?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Not the left button!"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Which one's that?!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  <em>(groan, sigh, urgh)</em>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, never mind. 'Properties' is listed."
</ul><p>
From all I could tell, everything went fine from then on.  The configuration
was right, and everything seemed to be working.  But on a visit to the client's
site later, we discovered multiple shortcuts all over the desktop and
quicklaunch bar, files placed wherever, and general disarray.
<p><hr><p>
My co-worker once downloaded a small program off the Internet, to her PC.  She
wanted me to copy it to a floppy so she could install it on her computer at
home.  That was fine, but she insisted I copy it from the icon she used to
open the program, right off the desktop.  No amount of explaining the concept
of "shortcuts" would deter her from having it done that way.  So I copied the
icon to a fresh floppy disk.
<p>
She took it home, couldn't understand why it wouldn't work, came in the next
day, and asked me about it.  "Maybe I need a higher density disk?" she asked.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't print anything!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, the print server's down for maintenance.
 Didn't you read that email I sent?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, I never got it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "But I got the return receipt from you.  You must
 have seen it: 'Server down at 4:00pm for maintenance'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, that one. I didn't understand what you meant."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(sigh)</em> "The tech is here trying to fix the
 SCSI controller. The server was downed so he could work on it."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What? I don't understand. Why can't I print? I'm not a
 computer person! I really need to get these reports out."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "When the message said, 'Please print your jobs
 before 4:00pm tomorrow,' what didn't you understand?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Huh? What? I really need to print these reports out.
 It's important!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You can't right now.  The server is turned off.
 Like I told you yesterday."
</ul><p>
Repeat for another ten minutes.
<p><hr><p>
Two friends and I were standing around one day.  One of them was fiddling
around with his computer, playing a game.  He recommended the game to us.
But my other friend said that he couldn't install it, because installing it
would take up all of his memory, and he'd need to get a new computer.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "What?"
<li><b>Friend</b>: "It would take up all of my memory."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Do you mean hard drive space? It won't take up any of
 your memory to install it."
<li><b>Friend</b>: "Yeah it would. I only have three gigabytes left."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Oh. You mean drive space.  But three gigabytes is plenty of room."
<li><b>Friend</b>: "But it'll take it all up!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Trust me. If it comes on one CD, it won't take up all of your drive space."
</ul><p>
Several hours later, I overheard him having a conversation with his
roommate. This conversation contained the phrase, "I'd get it, but if I
installed it it would take up all of my memory, and I'd have to get a new
computer." I just closed my eyes and sighed.
<p><hr><p>
One day a girl came to me and complained
that she couldn't install Macintosh's OS 8.5.  When I got to her
room I discovered she had a system running Windows 3.1.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "I can't install OS 8.5 on your machine.  This isn't a Macintosh."
<li><b>Her</b>: "Some computer genius you are, I'll just find someone
 else that can help me."
</ul><p>
Last I heard she was still searching for someone to help her.
<p><hr><p>
A customer called to order a copy of Windows 3.11.  I looked up her record our
our files and discovered her computer was an old 8086 system with a single
floppy drive.  Our general policy is not to sell products to customers we know
won't work, so I advised her that Windows would not run on her system.
<p>
A few days later, I got a call from the lady.  She had purchased Windows 95 on
a CD and wanted me to help her install it.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I don't have a cdrom drive, and the CD is too big
 to fit in the floppy drive.  And the software store won't take it
 back.  So you have to help me install this, because it's all your
 fault.  If you had sold me the version of Windows I wanted, I
 wouldn't have had to buy Windows 95."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>A Friend</b>:  "It takes forever for a web page to load on our
 computer.  How come yours is so much faster?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Well, what kind of modem do you have?"
<li><b>A Friend</b>:  "I think it's a 486."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Um, no that's a type of processor.  What speed of modem do you have?
<li><b>A Friend</b>:  <em>(confused)</em>  "Uh...well, it has Windows 95,
 it has 16 megs of RAM...I think it's a 14 something modem."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Ok, you'll need a faster modem to download pages faster."
<li><b>A Friend</b>:  "Why would it need a faster modem?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "My computer has a 56K modem, and that's a lot faster than
 the 14.4K modem you have."
<li><b>A Friend</b>:  "But why would it need a faster modem?  I could just
 install Windows 98, right?  That should speed it up."
</ul><p>
This was a few weeks ago. Since then, he bought the Windows 98 upgrade
and wanted to know if I could help them install it.  He was still convinced
that that was all he needed.
<p><hr><p>
I work for a major computer company as part of their direct sales phone
line.  Occasionally, customers will call to find local retailers that
sell our products in their area.  We can do that easily.
Unfortunately, someone called me and wanted to take it a step further.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "How may I help you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, I'm looking for <em>[third-party software]</em>."
<li><b>Me</b>: "I'm sorry, but we generally only sell products made by <em>[my
 company]</em>, and then mostly hardware."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh, I know that.  I wanted to know if that item is
 available in a store in my area."
<li><b>Me</b>: "There would be no way I could find that information for you."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, why not?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Because those stores are not owned by <em>[my company]</em>,
 and the program is not made by <em>[my company]</em>."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "They sell your products though, right?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Yes, but why would a company, which is not owned by us,
 call us up and say, 'Hey guys, we just got 100 boxes of
 <em>[software]</em>.'?  And why would we keep a record of it?
 Have you contacted the store directly to see if it's in stock?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "They said they didn't know when they were going to get it in."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Then why are you calling here?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "You guys have no @#$%ing patience.  I just asked you a
 simple question about your products."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "It's not our product.  We--don't--make--it."
</ul>
The conversation continued for another five minutes.
<p><hr><p>
I work for an ISP.  One day a woman called up with problems getting
Netscape to locate any sites.  After a couple questions it was obvious
that she wasn't getting connected.  So after a few minutes I got her to
the 'connect' window.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, have you ever seen this screen before?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, but I can't print it."
</ul><p>
I have no idea why she thought she needed to print this screen.  Even
after I explained that she didn't need to print the screen, she still
wanted to know how to print it.
<p><hr><p>
A automated inventory program, recently added to the network
had confused the hell out of many of our users. Each PC at our
site has a large white sticker next to the power switch with a
simple four digit asset number on it. When the audit program
runs for the very first time, the user is asked to enter the
asset number and told that this is the number on the sticker
beside the power switch on their PC.
<p>
So far, we've had, "WIN" from the Win3X users who are used
to entering 'win' at the keyboard after logging in to the network.
We've had "STICKER" entered, several times.  A number of people have entered
their initials.  And one poor fool entered "Intel Inside."
<p><hr><p>
I work for an accounting software company doing telephone support. A user
called in, obviously confused, and asked me:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My printers lights are flashing, what do I do?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "This is Accounting Software technical support."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ya, I know, just tell me what to do!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I would read the manual that came with your printer
 or call whoever you purchased it from."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well I'm trying to print in your software. Won't you help me?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I'm sorry sir, without the manual to your printer,
 I can't help you. You should really call the manufacturer."
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(expletive, blah, blah, blah, click)</em>
</ul><p>
About two hours later I got a call from the same guy.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I just bought a new printer and I want you to help me set it up."
</ul>
Uggh!
<p><hr><p>
I work in the tech support department of an ISP.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Hi. I got a Hewlett-Packard Laser Jet printer for
 Christmas, and I installed the software, and ever since then my screen
 is smaller.  It's a Daewoo monitor.  Why is that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Um, well, we are an Internet Service Provider, and
 we can really only offer technical support for Internet-related problems."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh.  Well I have another question that might be closer	
 to what you do."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "If I've got an image up on my screen in a program,
 how do I resize it?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, what can we do for you today?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Every time I touch this @#$% computer is shocks the
 @#$% outta me!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Oh, ok that's just static electricity. There are
 devices you can get to stop that from happening.  No big deal -- I'll
 send someone out there to take care of it."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, it's not static electricity. I <em>know</em> what
 static electricity feels like, and this ain't it. This computer is
 shocking me! And I know exactly why!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(dying from curiosity)</em> "Oh ok, tell me why."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Greg Parker is always over here messing around with my
 computer when I'm not at my desk. I told him to keep away from it, and
 he got mad, so he put a program on my computer that shocks me whenever
 I touch it! I can't even enter my lot numbers!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(trying not to laugh)</em> "No, it's gotta be
 static. There are no such programs. There's no way it could sense who you are."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "YES THERE IS! I SAW HIM DO IT! A few days after I told
 him to keep his filthy hands off of my computer, I saw him over here
 with one of them computer disks. That's when he did it! It started
 shocking me just after that happened!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, he was probably just copying his files off
 your computer since you wouldn't let him use it any more."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "LOOK! I'M TIRED OF GETTING SHOCKED! ARE YOU GONNA DO
 SOMETHING ABOUT IT OR NOT!?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine called me up in the afternoon, complaining that his
Windows 95 won't start. After half an hour of futile attempts to correct
the problem via the phone, I came over to his house. The first thing I did was
boot from a bootable disk and do a <em>DIR C:</em>. I saw nothing except
directories in C:, no <em>command.com</em>, no <em>io.sys</em>, etc.
As it turned out, my friend decided to get "top notch" performance out of
his computer, so he started removing all excessive "junk." Unfortunately for
him, he considered all files in the root dir of C: useless and
erased them all.
<p>
Having no other better solution, I reinstalled Windows 95.
Afterward, I told him not to erase any files from the
root directory of C:.  I went back home.  Twenty minutes later I received
a call from him complaining that Windows 95 broke again. Despite my warnings,
he cleaned up all the files in C:\ again.
<p><hr><p>
I received a phone call from a woman on the fifth floor saying the
software I wrote for her was broken.  (How does software break?)  I
knew I had never written software for her or anyone else on the fifth
floor.  But I went up to investigate.
<p>
She was using Crosstalk (a modem communications package) and for some
reason it wasn't dialing into a computer downtown.  I checked the
settings in the software; everything looked normal.  Just for fun, I
removed the cord from the modem and plugged it into a phone.
No dial tone.  The cord was disconnected from the wall.  So I crawled
under her desk and plugged it back in.  I assumed the cleaning people
knocked it loose.
<p>
A few days later I got another call about "my" software being broken
again.  Once again, the phone cord was yanked out of the wall.  I
tucked the phone cord away so there was no way a vacuum cleaner could
knock it loose.  But this continued to happen.
<p>
Then I noticed something.  This woman would sit with her legs
crossed, and one of her legs was kicking back and forth faster than a
hummingbird's wings.  I told her she was kicking the phone cord loose.
I went back to my cubicle to get tie wraps and a shorter phone cord.
<p>
No sooner had I collected these items than my boss' boss and his boss
were standing there.  Apparently this woman called and told them I had
written Crosstalk, and it wasn't working, and I had blamed her for the
problem.  I tried in vain to explain to them that I had <em>not</em> written
Crosstalk, that it was a commercial piece of software, etc.  They didn't
care.  All they knew was I had better debug my Crosstalk program and
make sure she didn't have any more problems.
<p>
After I secured the phone cord, she didn't have any more problems.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hello, is this tech support?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Yes, it is; what is the nature of the problem you're having?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't seem to power this thing up."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "If you are unable to boot your computer, sir, I
 suggest you contact the manufacturer.  This is Internet technical support."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Computer?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Yes, your computer."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I don't have a computer."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What is the item you are having difficulty with?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My new lawn mower."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  <em>(stifling a giggle)</em>  "Sir, you have
 reached Internet technical support. I suggest you double-check the
 number and try again."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, I'm sure I got it right.  Are you going to send
 anybody out to fix this damn thing?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sir, we do not support lawn mowers.  Please
 check the number and try it again."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "What kind of *@#%! service is this?  *&amp;$#^ you!  I
 wasn't born yesterday, you know!"  <em>(click)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't send mail to anybody outside my domain."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What happens when you try to send mail
 outside of the domain?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "It bounces back."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Would you happen to know the error message?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Look lady, I'm a UNIX systems administrator, and the
 problem is on <em>your</em> end, not mine."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Could you give me one of those addresses you
 can't send mail to?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yeah, but I don't see how it'll help."
</ul><p>
I went into a shell and sent email to the customer, watching it as
it passed through our servers and was accepted by the other domain.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, I'm able to send to it just fine, and
 since I'm on the same server that you are, the problem obviously
 isn't on our end.  What kind of account do you have with us, so
 I can get a little background?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have a UNIX shell account.  Look, lady, when am I
 going to get passed to a real technician?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sir, the problem is that your <em>sendmail.cf</em>
 file is configured incorrectly.  Unfortunately, since we don't support
 UNIX in this call center, you will have to fix it yourself."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Myself? The problem is on <em>your</em> server, dammit!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sorry sir, but <em>sendmail.cf</em> is the file you
 need to modify.  We do not support UNIX; however we do offer
 consultancy contracts if you are not able to modify the file yourself."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have no *^%$*ing idea how to do it!  Besides, it's
 on <em>your</em> server!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, if you do not fully comprehend the
 situation you now find yourself in, I suggest you either pick up
 O'Reilly's book on configuring <em>sendmail.cf</em> or find another line of work."
</ul><p>
Click.  Hysterical laughter.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, sir, please set the modem speeds from your
 telephone numbers down to 2400."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Why can't I leave them at 57,600?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Because, sir, you have a 2400 baud modem.
 57,600 is not appropriate for your modem."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Everything is too slow at 2400."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, you can always upgrade your modem."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "How can I do that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You can purchase a new modem at any local computer
 store. Most of them will even install it for you."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't want to buy a new modem. Can't I make this modem go faster?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No sir, you have a 2400 baud modem. That is as fast
 as this modem will go."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok, I set it to 2400." <em>(tries to sign on and
 fails again)</em>  "See?  That wasn't the problem!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, let's go back in and make sure that your
 changes to the modem speeds were saved."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Why can't I at least put it at 9600??"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't send email anymore."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, have you installed any new software recently?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No."
</ul><p>
The problem was that her DNS numbers had mysteriously disappeared.  I helped
her restore her settings.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Thanks.  I guess the DNS numbers got lost when we
 reinstalled Windows 95 last week."
</ul><p>
Oh well. It wasn't <em>new</em> software, was it?
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Are you down?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No. What's the problem you're having?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Netscape won't pull up any pages. Everything else works though."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did you make any changes to the system before it stopped working?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Of course not!"
</ul><p>
(Skip twenty minutes of troubleshooting.)<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Could Windows 95 be causing this problem?
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What do you mean?
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I upgraded to Windows 95 a few days ago...but I
 didn't like it. It wouldn't uninstall, so I just deleted files until
 Windows 3.1 came back."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(sigh)</em> "Yes sir, that could very well be
 the source of the problem."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Email from a customer with the shareware version of a software product:<p>
<blockquote>
As I mentioned, we are able to transfer the files with no major problem,
but there seems to be one problem that creeps up after we have
transferred five files.  After five files, we have to
re-initialize the program to be able to transfer again.  I want to
register the software but need to know if this problem has been
addressed in the registered version.  If it has, I'll immediately send a
payment out so we can get it.
</blockquote><p>
I emailed the user back and asked him if he had read the text of the error
message given after the five files were transferred, which reads:<p>
<ul>
<li>"Maximum number of transfers exceeded for shareware version.
Log out and log back in again for a new session.
This software must be registered to allow for more transfers per session."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One user was <em>very</em> angry with me, because the documentation that I had
written did not work for him at all.  So I walked him through the document
step by step.  As I went along, I asked him what had happened on screen as he
completed each step.  When I got to step 5, I got total silence as a response.
When I asked him again what happened when he did step 5, he said, "Oh, I didn't
understand what that step was for, so I skipped it."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Now click on 'OK'."
</ul>
<em>[sounds of furious clicking and typing]</em>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Hello?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Hold on a second."

I once had to deal with a user who was upset because she could
not edit her document.  I asked her what application she was
using, and she said WordPerfect for Windows.  I asked her what the
problem was, and she said she had loaded the document into the
computer, was able to see and read the words but could not
edit the text.  I was puzzled until she told me she had scanned in
the document; we do not have any OCR (optical character recognition)
software, and she had inserted the bitmap image of what she had
scanned in into the file.  I tried to explain, but she didn't
listen.  I could only shake my head as she scanned it in again
and kept on trying.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I started my account with you a month ago and this
 month I got a bill from both you and CompuServe."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "And...?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "And I just found out that whenever I start Netscape or
 any other program, it signs me on to CompuServe instead of you guys."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Did you read the section in the manual we sent
 about logging in?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I shouldn't have to read anything.  It's your job to
 tell me of any possible problems I may have."

One woman called Dell's toll-free line to ask how to install the
batteries in her laptop.  When told that the directions were on the first
page of the manual, says Steve Smith, Dell's director of technical support, the
woman replied angrily,  "I just paid $2,000 for this damn thing, and I'm not
going to read the book."

I received a call from a customer who was having some permissions
problems...<b>grantpt</b> wasn't working, so he couldn't get shells
open, etc, etc.
<p>
So, I started going through the permissions on his machine.  A
<b>ls -ld /</b> command showed 775.  This was fine.  A
<b>ls -ld /usr</b> command showed 777.  This was not.
<p>
I told him this was probably not directly the problem, but that we
should change it anyway...so I asked him to change it to 775.  I
even told him the command he could use: <b>chmod 775 /usr</b>.  He said
ok.  Then I asked him to <b>cd</b> into <em>/usr</em>, do an <b>ls -l</b>
there, and tell me what he saw.  He said he was still waiting.  I asked
"For what?  The <b>cd</b>?  The <b>ls</b>?"  His response, "The
<b>chmod</b>."  EEK!
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What EXACTLY did you type?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "<b>chmod -f -R 775 /u</b>..."
</ul>
I didn't even let him finish before I told him to type control-C.
<p>
I ended up suggesting he re-install from scratch, because he
apparently didn't have very much user data, and what little he did
have, he had backups that he could restore from if need be.  The
original problem, in fact, had been that he had done a <b>chmod -f -R
777 /usr</b>, which will completely hose any setuid permissions on
any file in <em>/usr</em>.

Most people eventually figure out that you have to press return after your
login ID and after your password or Windows will gripe at you and become
generally unpleasant and sullen.  Not one couple, who called all of
<em>nine</em> times and still hasn't quite managed to get the hang of it.
<p>
"Ok, tell me again; what do I do after I enter my password?" he keeps asking.
<p><hr><p>
A customer called in and stated that his system locked up in a
spreadsheet application.  He then told me, "You techs don't care
about our data that we work on.  I knew that you would have me turn
the computer off and reseat the video card, so in order to save
my data, I reseated the video card with the system on."  I finally
convinced him that we needed to turn the computer off and then
back on.  Guess what?  When we turned the computer back on, all we
heard was a series of long and short beeps, which, by the way,
weren't even correct beep codes.
