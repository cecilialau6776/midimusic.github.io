<blockquote>
<h4>
Printers are simple, relatively speaking, in terms of their
functionality.  Send something to the printer, and the printer
prints it.  Apparently, however, there is still a lot of
room for mucking up.

<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I tried to print but the computer can't find the
 printer.  Come over and fix it, NOW!!!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Is it turned on?"
</ul>
Silence.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It's turned on NOW, but it still doesn't print."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Did you let it warm up?"
</ul>
Silence.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It seems to be working now.  I guess you don't have to come over."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Is this a local or a LAN printer?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "It's on my desk."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Could you please come over and assign my C:\ drive to
 the laser printer?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Got a call from a woman said that her laser printer was having problems:
the bottom half of her printed sheets were coming out blurry.  It seemed
strange that the printer was smearing only the bottom half.  I walked her
through the basics, then came over and printed out a test sheet.  It printed
fine.  I asked her to print a sheet, so she sent a job to the printer.  As
the paper started coming out, she yanked it out and showed it to me.  I
told her to wait until the paper came out on its own.  Problem solved.
<p><hr><p>
I have been the technical support for a group of engineers for several years.
In the beginning they weren't sure a female could be high tech enough for
them. As a result they often spent a lot of time working on a problem before
calling me for help. One day I walked by a cubicle and saw two engineers
working hard over a printer. About an hour later I walked by and, noticing they
were still puzzled by the problem, I asked if I could help. They began to
explain all the steps they had taken to try to get the dot matrix printer to
work. I still treasure the looks on their faces as I took one finger,
pressed the cover latch into place, and it began printing.
<p><hr><p>
We had a customer that returned a printer to the store complaining about feed
problems.  He was trying to print on a "plain white tea towel," and it jammed.
The towel was still in the printer when he brought it back.
<p><hr><p>
Another customer calling the Canon help desk complained that his
BJC-610 was not printing red.  After the tech ran the customer through
a few unsuccessful cleanings, he asked the customer to remove the red
tank and see how much ink was in it.  The customer then said, "No, it
doesn't have any ink.  On page 130 in the manual, it said to do some
extensive cleanings.  So I drained the ink and filled it with water
to clean it."
<p><hr><p>
I had been doing Tech Support for Hewlett-Packard's DeskJet division for
about a month when I had a customer call with a problem I just couldn't
solve.  She could not print yellow.  All the other colors would print
fine, which truly baffled me because the only true colors are cyan,
magenta, and yellow.  For instance, green is a combination of cyan
and yellow -- but green printed fine.  Every color of the
rainbow printed fine except for yellow.  I had the customer change ink
cartridges.  I had the customer delete and reinstall the drivers.  Nothing
worked.  I asked my co-workers for help; they offered no new ideas.
After over two hours of troubleshooting, I was about to tell the customer
to send the printer in to us for repair when she asked quietly, "Should I
try printing on a piece of white paper instead of this yellow construction
paper?"
<p>
Sometimes the user can teach us a thing or two about tech support.
<p><hr><p>
I recently spoke with a woman who wanted to change the language her 
printer driver used (i.e., English, Spanish, etc.) thinking that it would
print a document written in one language out in another.  
<p><hr><p>
I support high end accounting software, not hardware, which makes this call all
the more amusing.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My printer is broken!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, actually, I don't handle hardware, only software."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "What's the difference?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  <em>(Oh no!)</em>  "What is your printer doing?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "The light is blinking, and it's saying, 'Toner Low'!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Can you still print?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well all you need to do is change the toner
 cartridge in the printer.  Your printer isn't broken -- you're just
 low on toner."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "What's toner?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "It's the powder used to print the actual
 characters on the paper.  Kind of like what you use in your copy
 machine only the printer cartridge fits in your printer."
</ul><p>
The customer called back later.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "It doesn't fit!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What doesn't fit?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "The bottle.  I can't find a hole to screw the bottle
 into in my printer."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A customer couldn't get his printer to work, so he brought it in for me to
look at.  I opened it up, and he cautioned me not to let the ink spill out.
I opened the ink cartridge bays and found sponges dripping with ink in them.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Where are the ink cartridges?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Those are them."
<li><b>Me</b>: "No, <em>these</em> are ink cartridges." <em>(holding one in
 my hand)</em>
<li><b>Him</b>: "No, the ink cartridges are inside those."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I have a G3 Powermac and a Apple Stylewriter printer.
 Both have an RJ45 -- I think it's what you call a Tbase10.  Anyway,
 I wanted to network them.  What do I need?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Roughly, how many other computers are on the
 network and do you have a central hub, or do you just have a data
 outlet in your office that you plug into?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "What do you mean when you say 'network'?  It's just
 my computer and this printer, and they both have that big phone jack
 thingie on them.  What do I need to hook them together?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "You mean besides a printer cable?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I just bought one of your computer packages, but I
 can't get the printer to work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, what is doing?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It just doesn't work.  When I try to print, nothing at
 all happens, and then my computer says that it can't find my printer."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Are you sure that you had the printer hooked up correctly?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, I have it plugged into the wall."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you have the printer cable plugged into your
 computer?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't know. I was reading the instructions, and it
 was saying something about plugging it into the computer, but that was
 too complicated. I just set the printer right next to the computer,
 like it shows in the picture. I thought that it might be too far away,
 but I got it as close as I could, and it still wouldn't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Um.....  You need to plug you printer cable in. It
 goes from your printer to your computer. I think you should have gotten
 one with your computer package. Do you have one?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't think so. I had some weird looking cable, but I
 thought it was extra, so I threw it away."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, you are going to need to get another printer
 cable, and you use it to connect the printer to the computer."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It doesn't show that in the picture."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, it may not show it there, but you do need it
 for your printer to work."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh. Ok. This is all pretty confusing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "All you need to do is get a printer cable and
 then plug your printer into your computer."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "So you mean I need to buy extra stuff to get my computer
 to work?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, one came with you computer, but you said you
 threw it away."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I think I'm just going to call the neighbor. I think
 he will be able to get it to work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok ma'am, but you will need a printer cable."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My neighbor is pretty good with computers."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, have a nice day."
</ul><p>
I burst out laughing as soon as she left.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Student</b>: "My paper won't print."
<li><b>Teacher</b>: "Did you tell it to print?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "Oh yeah, right.  How do I do that?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One user, in explaining to a computer science Master's student
how a dot matrix printer worked, pointed out some of the controls,
guessing tentatively at what they did.  "This must be the power
switch," he said, pointing to the "on-line" button.  He went
on to say, "I think if you sit down with it, play around with it
a little bit, I'd say -- since you know a bit about computers --
I'd say you'd have it down pat in about a week."
<p><hr><p>
One of my VAX users came to me to ask, "Why did the printer print out my memo
in all capital letters?"  After checking the port configuration on the VAX to
make sure it was set to "lower case," and checking the dip switches on the
printer, I did what I should have in the first place:  check the document.
Sure enough, the document had been typed in with all capital letters.
<p><hr><p>
One office had just installed a new Apple LaserWriter II for their Macs.  The
first day, they called me up and told me that it was printing the college
letterhead on each piece of paper.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Are you sure it's PRINTING the letterhead, or are
 you using pre-printed paper?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh no, it must be printing it, because they just put
 in plain white paper."
</ul>
Thinking this was going to be a semi-interesting problem, I headed over there,
and, sure enough, there was the college letterhead on each sheet of paper,
embossed in three colors from the printing house.  When I pointed out the fact
that they were, in fact, using pre-printed paper, she responded:
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "But I told the computer I didn't <em>want</em> a
 header.  And it still shows up, huh?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One afternoon, I was sitting next to a friend of mine at one of the University
of New Hampshire's computer clusters.  The guy on the other side of him asked
for help printing a file.  My friend told him the correct command that would
send his document to the correct printer.  When it didn't work, my friend
took a closer look at the problem.  It turned out that the reason the file
wouldn't print was because he had not yet created it.
<p><hr><p>
A man attempting to set up his new printer called the printer's tech
support number, complaining about the error message:  "Can't find the printer."
On the phone, the man said he even held the printer up in front of the screen,
but the computer <em>still</em> couldn't find it.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Hewlett-Packard Customer Service, this is Sergio,
 can I help you?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, I have a deskjet that I need to have repaired."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "We make several deskjets ma'am -- do you know what
 model yours is?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It's a Hewlett-Packard!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes, I know....umm, could you tell me if your
 deskjet is color or black and white?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well...it's beige."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I'd been on the phone for a good number of minutes to this user, trying to
verify the status of a particular record to see why it wasn't included on a
report. I managed to get every detail off the screen, except the one field I
really needed.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, just print out the record, and fax it over to me
 so I can read the bits I need."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "How do I do that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Just type 'print'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It's asking where I want to send it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, select your printer."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Now what?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Just fax that over."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Fax what?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "The stuff that came out of your printer."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What's that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What's what?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "A printer?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, it's the thing that prints. It's a bit like a
 typewriter with no keys. You put plain paper in one end, and it comes
 out the other end with writing on it."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What color is it?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Co-Worker:</b>  "If I had a color monitor, would my printer print in color?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My boss doesn't like the way my red-lined text prints.
 He wants me to change it.  It looks red on my screen but it doesn't print red."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well sir, it's not a color printer. It won't print red."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "How do you unsave something in the printer?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Me think the printer doesn't work.  It always refuses
to print the last page of my listing."
</ul>
After some hard thinking...
<ul>
<li><b>Operator:</b>  "Did you try the form feed button before tearing off your listing?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Form feed??"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I was working at the help desk when a
secretary called saying she was having problems with her printer.  It was
apparently spitting out "weird characters."  I went down to her office
thinking I would just have to replace the printer driver, so while she was
taking a call, I did so and sent a test page through.  No
problems. I left her a note and left while she was still on the phone.
<p>
No more than ten minutes later, I got a call from the same woman.  She was
having the same problem.  I went down to see and asked her to show me what
she was doing.  She proceded to double-click on a file, and the file came
up with binary data.  Then she hit 'print' before I could stop her.  I removed
the print job, told her that the printer would, in fact, not print out binary
data in English, and went to the printer to collect the few pages that had
printed before the job was cancelled.
<p>
At the printer, I noticed a huge stack of paper, approximately 1500 sheets.
These printers only hold 500 -- while the printer was spitting out
page after page of garbage, she kept refilling the tray.
<p><hr><p>
I wrote a piece of software that would query our master database every
night and print out data collected the day before.  Admittedly, it had
an undesirable "feature" in that if the printer wasn't on, it would dump
the data to the hard drive instead.  This was in 1988, and all we had
were 10 meg hard drives.  If the printer wasn't available, the hard drive
would quickly fill up and crash the machine.
<p>
I kept getting calls from this manager complaining my software was
broken.  Each and every time he'd have his printer turned off.  I
would tell him his printer <em>had</em> to be on in order for the program
to print the data, and every time he told me he was
afraid of excess wear and tear on the printer and insisted he <em>had</em> to
turn it off every night.
<p>
How can something be printed on a printer that's turned off, I asked.
He asserted that my program should turn on the printer, print the
information, and turn it back off when the print job was done.
<p><hr><p>

One of my users asked me to send an important document via email.  I sent
it to her.  It was a Microsoft Word document, sent as an attachment.
<p>
An hour later, the user called.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>User</b>:  "I need you to send me your printer drivers so I can print this document."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ma'am you don't really need my printer drivers to print this
 document. All you need to do is open the document with your copy of
 Word, then click on the button with the little printer on your toolbar."
<li><b>User</b>: "!&amp;$%/!@&amp;*, don't try and tell me how to use a computer,
 I know more about them than you can ever dream of !@#$@!^#!!...."
<li><b>Me</b>: <em>(trying not to laugh)</em>  "Ma'am, I'm pretty sure on
 this. My printer drivers would not be of much use to you unless you
 have the same exact printer as I do."
<li><b>User</b>: "All right, that's it. I want to speak to your supervisor."
</ul><p>
I transferred the call to my boss, and they had a similar conversation.
Finally she told him we were both idiots and didn't know the first thing
about computers.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Hi. Are you in the Moraga office?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "We do have offices located in Moraga."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, I mean are you in the actual offices in Moraga?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Uhh, yes."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Good! My printer is broken, and I was wondering if I
 could come down with a disk and use your printers?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I'm sorry ma'am, but these are closed facilities.
 We can help you with matters pertaining to Internet access but do
 not provide the public with free access to our network."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, that's ok. You were closer, but I can just go
 over to my friend's house and print my document there."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One of our company's internal help desk calls:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hello.  I can't print my document out."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Are you using Word Perfect?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I don't know about this stuff.  Could you just come
 over, I'm in room 123."
</ul><p>
When I got to her office, I discovered she didn't have a printer.  I politely
pointed this out, and then asked:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Where did you expect the paper to come out?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "The television."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I run a computer lab at a large junior high school, and I also
take care of the everyday problems that happen to Macs in the
classrooms.  Last month, the Science Department was able to get a
630 with an HP 560C for each science room.  All was fine until I
got a call from the teacher in room E-3.  E-3 is easily two city
blocks away from my lab, where I am frequently summoned to fix
such problems as unplugged cables or an un-chosen Chooser on Mrs.
E-3's personal PowerBook.  This time, E-3's new printer wasn't
printing.  I really didn't have time to jog clear across campus for
another nuisance call.  I recited my usual litany over the phone.
"Power?  Cables?  Chooser?  Has anything else unusual happened
lately?"  "Yes," replied E-3, "the printer smells of mouse urine."
I checked the calendar.  It wasn't April 1.  Then I remembered the
last time I had visited that particular science lab -- I had stepped
in a glue trap intended for a classroom pet gone feral.
<p>
"Yup!" I diagnosed.  "Your printer has mice!"  Having had some mice
as lab mascots myself, I was aware of a rodent's tendency to chew.
"He probably nibbled a wire inside."
<p>
And that's exactly what was wrong.  I presented myself to the
principal and told him that if he didn't call an exterminator
<em>right now</em> I would go to the SPCA and get a crew of cats.  He did,
I didn't, and now the only mice we have are attached to Macs.
<p><hr><p>
A friend who was in field service for Burroughs, and is currently at Unisys,
tells of the time he went to do some routine PM at a customer site.  As he was
getting ready to button up the hardware, he asked the girl who was the operator
for the machine in question to queue up the system status report to the printer
so he would have it by the time he was ready to leave.  The silence, nothing
printing, was quite noticeable.  Seeing that the printer was off line, he asked
again if she would run the report.
<p>
"Oh, yes," came the response, "it'll be printing in a moment.  I'm just
waiting for the phone to ring."
<p>
"I beg your pardon?"
<p>
"I'm waiting for the phone to ring so the report will print."  Mildly
curious, he inquired what arcane influence the telephone had over the system
printer, and piece by piece the story emerged.
<p>
About 6 months previously, when she was a new hire, the DP manager had asked
her to queue up a report.  He was going to another building, and for some
reason didn't want the thing to print until he got there, so he told her to
keep the printer off line so that he could phone her when he was ready.
<p>
"As soon as the phone rings, press the online button, there, and let 'er rip."
This she had duly done, and from that day forward, whenever anyone had called
asking for a report, she would take the printer off line, queue up the report,
and wait for the phone to ring.  No one at the customer site realized what she
was doing, because whenever anyone would call the machine room to ask where a
requested report was, she would say, truthfully, "It's printing right now."
