<h4>
Some of the things people do to computers is downright painful.
</h4>
</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
Recently, I got a call from someone who turned off his computer whenever he
found himself somewhere in Windows he didn't want to be.  "I just turn it
off when I don't like where I am," he said.  Wonder of all wonders, scandisk
found a score of lost allocation units and bad sectors.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Hi, I was wondering if you could fix my laptop.
 It's under warranty."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What seems to be the trouble with it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My wife got mad and threw it in the pool."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A man purchased a laptop from me. He called about a week later and said
that it would no longer boot up. He brought it in, and I discovered that
sixteen nicely drilled holes were in the bottom of the case. I asked him about
it, and he said the machine was too hot sitting on his lap, so he had drilled
these "air holes."<p>
"Could that be the problem?" he asked.
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine (who shall remain nameless) bought a brand new Toshiba
laptop computer last year since his "old" one was a model from the year
before.  He worked in the computer services office on campus here at our
university.  He decided one night that to impress his co-workers he
would make his new laptop more decorative.  He
bought a can of emerald green Krylon spray paint and sprayed his entire
computer (screen, mouse, keyboard, casing, and all) with it.  He was
shocked to find that his computer wouldn't work afterwards and
decided the paint must be at fault.  So the next day he
bought a can of Goo Gone and a bottle of paint thinner and
poured them both on his computer, then rinsed it off in the sink.
<p>
Again, he was shocked when his computer wouldn't work.  He was even more
shocked when Circuit City told him they wouldn't refund his money or
exchange his computer for a new one.
<p><hr><p>
A customer came into the store one day to return an internal modem, which he
had purchased a few days earlier.  He complained that it would not work.
I took the modem out of the package and could scarcely believe my eyes.
<p>
The card had been filed down to about half its original size.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Why has this card been filed?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "The modem didn't fit in the slot, so I had to
 file it till it would fit."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Ten years ago, I was working for a company selling computerized cash
registers. A customer called in to help me with a cash register that
didn't connect to the back office computer.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "So, can you tell me the settings of the DIP switches on the cash register?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "DIP switch?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Oh, sorry, the small switches located on the backside."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Eeeerrr...there are no switches there."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Oh, yes, there are. Right next to the power cord."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No. There are no switches. Not any more!"
<li><b>Me</b>: <em>(puzzled)</em> "Huh? Not any more? What do you mean?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, you know, my collegue told me that these
 switches might actually be what caused the problem, so I removed them."
<li><b>Me</b>: "REMOVED THEM??"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yeah, you know, removed them. With a chisel."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
About a year ago, I was called out to do field service. When
I got to the lady's house and was let in, the first thing I noticed was the
smell of gunpowder. The second, the double barreled 12-gauge shotgun lying on
the couch. Third, the big gaping hole in the side of her computer. (It was
one of those Macs where the CPU and monitor are in the same housing.)
<p>
I looked at her. She was a little grey haired woman, around 60 or so. Had she?
Not possible. Still, I had to ask.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Did you shoot...?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, I got a little mad at it.  They told me I couldn't
 hurt it, but I think they were wrong. Can you salvage anything?"
</ul><p>
I mumbled something about not being a Mac tech and told her I
would send one out as soon as I could. Then I burned rubber out of there.
<p>
About a month later, my boss called me in; he had the woman on hold. She had
apparently complained that I was not competent and that I had lied when
I said I would send out a competent Mac tech -- or perhaps I just hadn't been
able to find anyone competent working for us. I filled him in. He paused for
a second, picked up the phone, and said, "Ma'am? Did you put a shotshell
into your computer? ... Uh huh...I'm sorry, ma'am, we really can't...well,
no....  I'll try to send one out.... Nice doing business with you...." He hung
up, looked at me, and said, "You think any of our Mac techs will go?"  I
shook my head.  "Me neither."
<p>
We heard from her again last week, when my boss told me that the woman
had called up to cuss me out, saying not only was I a "young whippersnapper"
but also a liar, since one of our competitors had fixed her computer just
fine, even fixing the little scratches and stuff on the monitor glass. That
sounded fishy, so I went over and talked with the techs. After a case
of canned drinks and a few bags of junk food, I wormed the whole story out of
them. Apparently, about the only salvagable part was the hard drive (which
the buckshot had missed), so they took it out, went out and bought a whole new
computer, slapped the hard drive in, and presented it to the lady as her
repaired computer -- of course charging her an arm and a leg.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "About time too. Are you a real person?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes sir, how can I help you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I moved some stuff I don't use to the trash and
 deleted the trash, and now I'm getting all sorts of %&amp;*#ing errors.
 What are you going to do about it?  You've got an accent, haven't you?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes sir, I'm in Ireland."
</ul>
<p>
It became apparent that the customer, in his wisdom, had destroyed the
Windows registry and deleted just about everything he needed to run Windows.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, I believe we will have to reload your system
 with its original operating system, as you are presently unable to
 get into your system due to the necessary files being deleted.
 Unfortunately you will lose anything added since you purchased
 the system. Shall I walk you through the reload sir?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "You mean I paid $2,000 dollars, and I have to
 reload this myself?" <em>(rants for fifteen minutes, makes death
 threats and references to being supported by a third world country)</em>
 "*&amp;@$ing reload!  I'll give you a reload!"
</ul><p>
Bang!  Bang!<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, is everything all right?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Sure is. I just blew the $#%&amp;ing thing to bits with my
 shotgun you *$@%ing &amp;*%$er."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(taking a satisfying long breath)</em> "Sir,
 I would like to advise you at this point that gunshot damage is
 not covered under the terms and conditions of your warranty. May
 I suggest a servicer in your locality to assist in the reassembly
 of your machine?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "$%!# you."
</ul><p>
I dissolved into fits of laughter.
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine asked me to take a look at her computer.  She
said the computer was unusually "quiet" and would reboot itself on
occasion.  I surmised correctly that the fan on her power supply
was faulty.  She was a chain smoker and apparently smoked a lot
while working on the computer; not only was the power supply fan
gummed up with revolting tar and nicotine, but the CPU's cooling fan was
clogged beyond use, and the cdrom drive drawer would not open.  This is
the only computer I have ever worked on that died from smoking.
<p><hr><p>
I do PC support for a national waste disposal company.  I troubleshooted
a PC in Alabama once.  The PC gave a disk error when it was turned on.
I placed a system disk floppy in the drive and tried to boot off that, but
it didn't work.  Then, when I removed the disk, it was covered in dirt.
I opened the computer and found several inches of caked mud on the inside.
I asked the site supervisor about it.  He told me there had been a flood,
but they had cleaned off the PC.
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine was calling in, complaining that his computer suddenly
making very strange noises. knowing that I am a computer tech guy he
asked if I could fix it. So I went there, and his computer
really did sound strange, and both the disk drive and the cdrom drive
appeared to be dead.  So I opened the case, unplugged the disk drive and
the cdrom, and the strange sound was gone.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "It looks as if your floppy drive is stuck somewhere and
 can't move its inner head.  Did you do anything unusual lately?"
<li> <b>My Friend</b>:  "Oh no, I didn't do anything.  Do you think it
 could be related to the rain coming in through the open window last week?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "It depends.  How much water was it?"
<li><b>My Friend</b>:  "Ah, not much.  It was that night when the power
 went out, and I had to replace the fuses."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "What?  Not much water but the power went out?"
</ul><p>
I opened the case and I found both the cdrom drive and the disk drive had
turned green and brown with rust.
<p><hr><p>
I'm in charge of the computer network in a small mall, which includes a cafe.
The cafe had an old 386 desktop machine, handling billing. Originally, the
machine was placed on the floor, elevated by a small wooden block, because that
floor was washed daily. When I had to service that machine, I discovered the
block was missing and the bottom of the machine was rusted, as if it came
from the bottom of the ocean. (Surprisingly, it still worked.)
<p><hr><p>
During a college course, we were being showed how to plug all the
components of a PC together properly. Getting a little bored, I glanced
over at the student next to me fumbling with all his cords and bending
all the way over the desk to see the rear of the PC (apparently it was
too difficult for him to turn it around).  While he was doing so, I
turned the brightness knob on his monitor all the way over so that when
he finally got the cables plugged in the correct order, nothing was on
his screen. I leaned over to "help."  I said, "Let me see if <em>this</em>
works," and slapped the side of the monitor while inconspicuously turning
the brightness knob back up with my other hand.  The next time he turned
around, I turned the brightness knob back down again and left the room.
When I came back, the poor guy was beating that monitor senseless.
<p><hr><p>
I was talking to a fellow co-worker on the phone yesterday:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Co-Worker</b>:  "My modem isn't working.  I think my kid was screwing with my PC."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "What's wrong with it?"
<li><b>Co-Worker</b>:  "It won't dial or connect or anything."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Maybe the configuration got changed.  Is it still hooked up?"
<li><b>Co-Worker</b>:  "No."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Oh, well, you need to hook it up.  Where is it?"
<li><b>Co-Worker</b>:  "It's in the fridge."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "The fridge?  Why the heck is it in the fridge?"
<li><b>Co-Worker</b>:  "Well, it started to get really hot, so I put it in there to cool off."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A client called Wednesday afternoon.  Her computer was dead.  All our
field techs were booked for the day, so we sent one out first thing
Thursday morning.  The problem was gone.
<p>
Next Wednesday she called again.  Thursday morning the tech arrived. No problem.
<p>
Next Wednesday she called again.  Thursday morning the tech arrived. No problem.
<p>
He brought the computer in for service.  I ran the computer
two days on diagnostics with no problem, and we returned the computer.
<p>
Next Wednesday she called again.  Thursday morning the tech arrived. No problem.
<p>
The following Wednesday, we had a tech sit with her all day.  At
lunchtime, she watered her plants, which, in turned out, she did every
Wednesday at lunch.  The plant above the computer started leaking.
<p><hr><p>
A woman called to report that her CD-ROM was no longer working.  After
going through the standard troubleshooting procedures, I asked her when
this problem started.<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Customer</b>:  "Oh, right after my toddler stuck some quarters
	into the [cdrom] drive."
<li> <b>Tech Support</b>:  "It sounds to me like the cdrom is broken.  You
	will need to take the computer to a service provider and have them
	replace the drive.  You'll have to pay for it to be fixed."
<li> <b>Customer</b>:  "I just bought this computer.  It should still be
	under warranty, shouldn't it?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I went on site for a system that had no display. I tried another video
card, but the system seemed really dead. When I asked the user for more
details, she said that someone had put a password on the CMOS, and she
wanted to get rid of it. She had read in a PC repair book about
using a jumper to clear the CMOS, which is true for some systems. But
when she opened the case, she found quite a few jumpers on the
motherboard. Undeterred, she began rearranging all of the jumpers (with
the system turned on). Hard to say which component fried first. Oh well,
time to upgrade anyhow.
<p><hr><p>
I've worked in a software store for a couple years now.  I've had more
than person irate that we sold them a Playstation CD that doesn't work on
a computer, a computer CD that doesn't work on a Playstation, and even
someone who wanted Windows 95 for the Playstation.  But none of these compare
to this one user:
<p>
On Friday, a man came in, carefully browsed the store, and purchased
a brand new copy of James Bond 007 for the Nintendo 64.  I sold him a strategy
guide to go with it at a 20% discount and sent him happily on his way.
I happened to be working the next day when he stormed back in.  He
spotted me and came running down the store, vaguely resembling a freight
train.
<p>
"You idiot!  This" -- shoving the game in my face -- "doesn't work in
my system!  I couldn't make it fit at all!  And I just brought the
system brand new, so it's a bad game, and I WANT MY MONEY BACK BECAUSE
YOU'RE SELLING BAD PRODUCTS!!!"
<p>
Well, it was within our seven day return policy, so I calmly accepted the
package and proceeded to open it to make sure it was still in saleable
condition.  To my great astonishment, it had apparently been neatly
trimmed down to around 3 1/2 inches with some sort of saw.
<p>
"Siiiir..?  What happened to this game?"
<p>
"Nothing!  I just cut it to fit in my Compaq!  It should work -- I just bought it!"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I just bought a Pentium II 300 from you, and I
 installed it as the manual instructed."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Let's go over the jumper settings of the board,
 and make sure all the connections are correct."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I know that is installed right. I've done this
 hundreds of times."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, take the CPU out of the slot and reinsert it,
 making sure it snaps into place."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "The CPU doesn't seem to fit properly.  Why don't I
 just bring this in. You will look at it, right?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sure, no problem."
</ul><p>
When the customer brought the motherboard and CPU in, I could not keep myself
from laughing.   He had installed the CPU into an ISA slot.  He had actually
<em>cut</em> the housing of the Pentium II CPU to make it fit.
<p><hr><p>
Hi I just talked to <em>[a PC retailer]</em>, and they told me to call you.
A water main in our house broke, and 85 gallons of water got dumped on my PC.
It's insured, but the insurance company will only cover the parts I can
prove are bad. I think it's dry now; can you help me troubleshoot it?
<p><hr><p>
A guy calls because he wants to register his Macintosh Performa
and needs to know where the serial numbers are on the computer and
modem.
<ul>
<li> <b>For the computer:</b>  "It's on the back of the computer."
<li> <b>Response:</b>  "Oh, I don't think I can get around to the back of it."
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <b>For the modem:</b>  "It's on the bottom of the modem."
<li> <b>Response:</b>  "I've got the modem attached with a C-clamp so it
	doesn't fall off."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Our tech support had a guy call in about a bad powerbook monitor.
It had tire treads on the left side of the screen.  He
repositioned his windows to the right, and it kind of worked.
Apparently, the powerbook was on the hood of his car, fell off, and
he backed over it.  It still booted, but the tire marks were very
visible on the screen.
<p><hr><p>
A friend worked for a company that made IC's.  Every few months, their yields
would go down to about zero.  Analysis of the failures showed all sorts of
organic material was introduced in the process, but they couldn't figure out
where.  One evening, someone was working late and came into the lab.  There
he found the maintainence crew cooking pizza in the chip curing ovens!
<p><hr><p>
We sold a new Pentium to a new customer.  After only a day or two it was
back in the shop.  She was complaining about many errors she was getting in
Windows:  a number of general protection faults, disk read/write errors, etc.
We brought the system to our shop, ran some tests...everything checked out
fine, so we sent it back.
<p>
Again a call came in from her, complaining about the same errors.  We ran
some tests, everything was fine, and we sent the machine back.  By the
fourth call, we decided there must be something in her office that was
causing the problems, so we asked her about microwave ovens, etc.  Nothing
like that was anywhere near her computer, according to her, so we sent a
technician over to take a look.  After five minutes on site the system
worked fine.  The technician removed the two dozen or so refrigerator magnets
that she had been decorating her computer with.
<p><hr><p>
Recently we were trying to talk one of our customers through an
installation of an SBUS card in a Sun SPARCstation 20.  About
halfway through the install, at a point where we had the top off
the machine and had been swapping RAM, moving hard drives, and
moving SBUS cards around for a while, one of the people at the
remote site commented that "funny things" were happening on her
monitor.  It was at that point that I realized that she had never
turned the computer off.
<p><hr><p>
I delivered and setup a PC in an office, gave some small training,
and agreed to follow up a week later.  When I returned, the monitor
was off the top of the PC and a typewriter in its place.  The
secretary felt the PC made a better typewriter stand than her
desk.
<p><hr><p>
A customer called complaining that his keyboard no longer
worked.  The customer had cleaned his keyboard by submerging it for
a day in warm soapy water in his bathtub.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Is it ok to clean my MAC in the tub as long as the power is off?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Can I help you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, my mouse isn't working. It was working fine yesterday."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, what is it doing, or not doing?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I have an arrow, but it doesn't move when I move the mouse."
<li> <b>Tech Support</b>: "Have you cleaned it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, I dropped it into a five gallon bucket of water last night."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You did what?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I opened the case and dropped it into a five gallon
 bucket of water and let it soak over night."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, ma'am, I would have to say that is probably your problem."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Nah, can't be! That won't hurt 'em as long as you let
 'em dry out completely before you try to use 'em again!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, ma'am, that's not exactly the case..."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Listen, that isn't the problem!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, well...ma'am, I don't know what else to tell
 you except--"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "So you're telling me to buy a new mouse."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I don't see anything else you can do."
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(click)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My computer doesn't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, what happens?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "When I turn it on, nothing happens."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Hmmm.  Can you think of anything you might have
 done to cause it to stop functioning?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, I just cleaned it.  There was dirt on the fan,
 and I wiped it off."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Oh, that shouldn't have hurt anything."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Then I opened up the computer and wiped the insides
 as well.  I took it apart and washed everything with Windex."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Once I was sitting at my desk, and a clerical worker came back and told me
that her terminal was putting all sorts of garbage on the screen.  I walked
back to her desk/office and looked around -- there was a rather large wet
spot on the floor, and an empty glass on the desk.  I lifted the keyboard
off the desk by the cord, and water literally <em>poured</em> out of it.
She said, "Oh!  Could that be the problem?"
<p><hr><p>
I once made the mistake of telling a customer to take his machine to a gas
station and have them blow the dust out.  I didn't figure on the gas station
handing him a 150psi air nozzle that belches rusty water and oil.
<p><hr><p>
One technician had forgotten to turn the printer off. What happened? He lost
his screwdriver, and it fell so awkwardly that it shorted the electrolytics
in the power supply.  The resulting ccurrent was so high, that it literally
"welded" the screwdriver to the connections, so that he afterwards could
carry the power supply out of the house just by lifting his screwdriver
<p><hr><p>
Last year a guy called and said his cdrom won't work after he installed
it. I asked him to bring it in.  while testing out the other drives, I
noticed it was really slick.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Did you get it wet?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Wet?  No way, that's the WD40 I used to get the drive
 to slide in easier."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Once we had a customer bring his system into our service center.
He seemed to know a little about computers but thought
he was an expert, so as soon as I started to ask a few basic questions
about his hard drive problems, he said, "Look, I know that it's the hard
drive thats stick because when I do this it works again."  As he spoke, he
lifted the back of the tower off the bench by about four inches and
dropped it.
<p>
My jaw dropped by about the same amount, and my
supervisor, who was nearby at the time, just stared at the system.  I recovered
enough to say, "Well, we'll take care of it now, so why don't I just take
that over here...."
<p>
Apparently he had been using this method to get his system going for the
past three months, but lately it was not working as well as it used to.
Surprise, surprise!
<p><hr><p>
Someone called my teacher (who is also a consultant) for a network contract.
The guy was complaining of endless timeout errors and slow performance,
even though his network was small (25-30 computers) and had decent equipment.
So my teacher showed up, and, to his great surprise, found that every cable
(10baseT - cat5) had various numbers of knots tied in each end. Not small,
loose knots but real tight ones.  Some of the cables had over 20 knots in them.
The boss explained that the guy who wired the network (who was unreachable)
made knots in the cables so he could identify them. The first PC had the
cable with one knot at each end; the second PC's cable had two knots at
each end, and so on.  Not bad for the first PCs, but the cable for the 20th
PC, with a total of forty knots in it, wasn't in very good shape.<p>
Hadn't this guy ever heard of a marker?  Or stickers?
<p><hr><p>
I got a call from a woman whose system was displaying hardware errors.
She said that this was related to a call they made a month ago.  I
researched the call she mentioned.  Both calls were regarding massive
hardware failure, but the error messages were different, and there was
nothing else in common.  I tried to call her back, but there was no answer.
Three hours later, she called me.  There were different errors now, and
some of the supercomputers weren't working at all.  I promised to contact
a hardware specialist immediately.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "By the way, why do you think it is related to the
 other call?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh, in both cases, the air conditioning had failed,
 and the computer room was over 150 degrees."
</ul>
That's the only time I ever let out a bloodcurdling scream in public.  And
she still refused to turn off the computers!
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Hello, yes, my system is crushed!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Crushed?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, that is what I said, crushed."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Oh, your system has crashed..."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, I cannot do anything, my mouse will not work, and
 I can't see anything on the screen.  I need it fixed now!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, I need some history on this problem.  What was
 the last thing you did before the system crashed?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, after I stood on the computer to hang a picture,
 my machine was crushed."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Oh, so your system has been crushed..."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
While working as the UNIX support for a major computer distribution company, I
had more fun with the people in the warehouse then should be allowed.
My pager went off with the message, "Program is down." I called to
the warehouse lead, and the following ensued:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Him</b>: "Bay F is not working; come over and fix it."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Fine, let's go take a look."
</ul><p>
As we entered the warehouse I saw the problem before we even get to the bay
itself. The bay was gone. I don't mean missing, I mean destroyed. The printers
were in pieces all over the floor, the table was spread out about twelve feet,
and the Wyse terminal was hanging from one of the blades of a fork lift.
<p>
I looked at the guy incredulously, but he was perfectly straight-faced.  He
wanted me to fix a bay they ran over with a construction vehicle.
<p><hr><p>

<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Where can I get a BIOS upgrade for by 286 computer?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "The unit should have been shipped with the latest bios."

<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I upgraded it to a 486DX-50."

 out and put the 486 on myself."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Sir, the 486 is bigger than the 286."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I know, I had to use quite a bit of solder to solder
 the extra pins together."
