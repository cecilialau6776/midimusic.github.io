<H3>1.1 Piecing It Together</H3>
<blockquote><h4>More than with any other product on the market today, people
 are willing to shell out hundreds of pounds to buy something
 of which they have no real conception - a computer.</h4></blockquote>
<p><hr>
<p>I used to work for MacWarehouse as a tech support representative.
 One day a gentleman called who had never had a computer before. He
 was trying to set up his new system. I tried and I tried but I just
 couldn't make him understand where to plug the cables in. Finally
 I looked up the details on his order. He had ordered top-of-the-line
 everything - monitor, keyboard, printer, modem, scanner, speakers,
 CD-ROM drive, external hard drive......except, he had not ordered the
 actual computer itself. No wonder the cables would not plug in
 anywhere.
<p><hr>
<p><ul><li><b>Customer:</b> "One of my friends gave me an ImageWriter printer and
 this keyboard. He said he gave me all the cables, but I can't figure out how to
 connect them. Am I missing something?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Well, a computer would help."
<li><b>Customer:</b> "You mean this keyboard isn't a word processor?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "No ma'am, its just an input device."
<li><b>Customer:</b> "Then I need to buy a computer, right?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Yes."
<li><b>Customer:</b> "Do you think I'll need a monitor, too?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p><ul><li><b>Customer:</b> "Do I need a monitor? I have everything else."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Yes, ma'am."
<li><b>Customer:</b> "Why? That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard of."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>On one occasion, a lady came into the store, apparently interested in buying
 a home computer. After surveying the models on display, she walked over to
 one and pointed to the monitor and keyboard saying, "I think I need one of
 these, and one of those...." She then pointed to the CPU and continued,
 "...but I don't think I need one of those."
<p><hr><p>Well, I had one event happen to me, where one lady had just bought
an Apple IIc and complained that she was having problems with her
 monitor, so we told her to bring her monitor in, and we'd check it
 out. So she brings her monitor in, and we plug it in, and it works
 without a flaw. We tell her that the monitor isn't the problem,
 and to bring her CPU in. She stares at us blankly, and asks,
 "What's the CPU?" Joe explains that it's the piece of equipment
 that all your devices plug into. So about twenty minutes later,
 she returns and walks in carrying the surge supressor. When we
 explained to her the item that we needed her to bring in, she
 replied, "Oh you mean the keyboard!" (On Apple IIc's, the CPU box
 and keyboard are part of the same unit.) And to make this all the
 more interesting, she was a school computer class instructor.
<p><hr><p>Back in the mid-eighties, the high school I went to had
 just purchased a handful of 8086s along with some basic hardware -- at
 that time these things still were horribly expensive. A few weeks later,
 the computer lab was broken into and some of the hardware stolen.
 But the computers themselves had been left untouched: only the
 monitors and keyboards were gone. Apparently, the only computers the
 thieves had known were C64s or Apple II's, where the computer and keyboard
 are part of the same unit. Imagine the frustration when these guys tried
 to get the stolen machines to work!
<p><hr><p>I was one of a group of students who would help other students and
 teachers at my high school with computer problems. One day I got a call
 from a teacher saying that her computer was not working at all.  I went
 to her room to find a perfectly good Mac PowerPC on her desk. With one
 problem.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Excuse me, ma'am.  Where's the keyboard?"
<li><b>Teacher</b>: "Oh, it's over there in my travel bag."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>A man who owned a small business asked me to program a sales and inventory
 system for him. He was replacing his old 286 PC and had been running a
 DOS-based program.
<p>He wanted all the bells and whistles, wanted it browser-driven, with
 images of all the products in his inventory. But the most important
 thing to him was that it all run off of floppies -- his 286's hard drive
 had crashed in the past and he lost all his records, so now he didn't
 trust hard drives. Not only did he want the whole thing on floppies,
 he wanted to be able to do a backup onto <em>one</em> floppy every night.
<p>The other thing was that he didn't want to use a mouse or any other sort of
 pointing device.
<p><hr><p>I was advising a friend on a used PC she was considering buying from a
 friend. I asked the friend if it was a Pentium PC, and he laughed, "All
 computers have Pentium processors!"
<p><hr><p>I was in our University Bookshop the other day looking at software when I
 overheard a salesman talking to a lady about an iMac.
<p><ul><li><b>Salesman</b>: "It has a built in color monitor and comes with a
 mouse and keyboard--"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Does this thing come with a battery backup system?"
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "No, but we have one over there for &pound;99.00.  Do you
 have problems with power outages?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, but I don't want to lose all of my Microsoft
 documents everytime I turn off the computer!"
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "You don't need a battery backup for that. That's why
 it has a 4 gigabyte hard drive."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "A hard what?"
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "A hard drive. It's like a whole bunch of floppy disks
 inside your computer that you can store documents on."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I want the battery backup."
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "You don't need it."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Why?"
