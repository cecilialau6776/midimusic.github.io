<h4>
Once optional, now essential, the mouse is one of the most
misused, misunderstood peripherals in the home computer market.
Keyboards and printers are easier to grasp by those already
familiar with typewriters, but the principles of the mouse
are incomprehensible to the mainstream.

<p><hr><p>
Several years ago I was at a computer show demoing software.  The
audience was comprised of retired school teachers.  I explained how
to use the mouse to point to things on the screen.  As I walked
around the room making sure everyone was doing ok, I saw one woman
holding her mouse to the Mac's monitor moving the mouse around on
the screen.
<p><hr><p>
One customer held the mouse in the air and pointed it at the screen like a
TV remote, all the while clicking madly.
<p><hr><p>
I was teaching a user about windows.
<ul>
<li><b>Me:</b>  "Move the cursor up to the menu line. . . .  Move the cursor
 to the menu line. . . .  Move the mouse up to move the cursor
 up to the menu line. . . ."
</ul>
Still, nothing was happening on the screen.  Finally I looked over her right
shoulder to see what she was doing.  She had raised the mouse literally
<em>up</em> -- about a foot off the desk.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, can you see the arrow in the middle of the screen?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Good!  Now trying moving the mouse around.  Do
 you see the arrow moving?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Not even a little?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, not at all."
</ul><p>
I spent several minutes having the user follow the cable from the the mouse to
the back of the PC. It was plugged in all the way.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, try moving it again.  Up, down, left, right -- anything?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Nope, still nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hmmm, maybe the table is too slippery -- why
 don't you try rolling the mouse on a book or a piece of paper?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh!! On the <em>table</em>!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One lady, in an Excel class, was having a terrible time with the mouse until
the instructor noticed that she was literally pointing with her finger and
clicking the mouse.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, to access the files on the disk click the
 mouse on the picture of the disk."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Nothing happened. I told you, I've already tried this."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, do it again.  Is the mouse moving?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yep."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "On the screen?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yep."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Now click twice on the picture of the disk."
</ul>
The consultant hears two clicks.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ma'am, double click once more for me."
</ul>
The consultant hears the two clicks again.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ma'am, are you hitting your screen with your mouse?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, now click your left mouse button."
<li><b> Customer</b>:  <em>(silence)</em>  "But I only have one mouse."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
And another user was all confused about why the cursor always moved in the
opposite direction from the movement of the mouse.  She also complained about
how hard it was to hit the buttons.  She was quite embarrassed when we asked
her to rotate the mouse so the tail pointed away from her.
<p><hr><p>
While training over the phone I heard, "Oh, wait.  Uh oh!!"  I asked
repeatedly, "What?  What's happening?" expecting to hear smoke was pouring
out of her computer.
<p>
Finally she recovered enough to scream, "My keyboard's in the way!  I can't
move my mouse!"
<p><hr><p>
I had a customer who phone in a panic because his mouse pointer wouldn't go
any further across the screen. After the usual questions to see if the
computer had frozen (it hadn't) the customer said, "No, it won't go any
further because I've run out of desk space."  The guy thought that position
of the mouse on the desk was analogous to the position of the pointer on the
screen.  He had no idea you could pick the mouse up and move it without
screwing things up.
<p><hr><p>
I remember when my Amiga arrived, way back in 1986.  I had a class to go to,
but my roommate was kind enough to set it all up for me.  When I got back from
class, he was having a great time playing with it.  His only problem was using
the mouse.  Turns out he was holding it in his hand and rolling the ball with
his fingers.  I don't even remember how he was coping with the mouse buttons.
<p><hr><p>
We taught first-years how to cope with using a computer.  We had one chap who
spent ages with the mouse upside down, using it as a trackball, before he
came and asked us if there was a better way.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Please right click the 'My Connection' icon on your screen."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Right click?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, press the right button on your mouse."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "There is no right button on my mouse. But there is one
 over the one I'm usually clicking."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ehh...is your mouse positioned horizontally or vertically?"
<li> <b>Customer</b>: "Horizontally."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Turn your mouse 90 degrees to the right, and then
 click the right mouse button."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ohh...it's a lot easier to use it now! It moves better
 too. Is this the way I'm supposed to use the mouse?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm so stupid!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
We had a member call up with the usual connection problems and the
tech rep on the call was wondering why it was taking the member
unusually long to do the simplest task such as selecting an item
from the menubar.  The member said that her cat had eaten her mouse
ball and she had to move the cursor by putting her finger in the
cavity where the mouse ball used to be and moving the rollers
manually.
<p><hr><p>
My mother wanted to look up something on the Internet.  Having never
touched a computer let alone the Internet, I showed her how to use the
mouse and the significance of the hyperlink.  She said, "I want to see what
this page says," so I told her to put the mouse pointer over the icon and
click the left mouse button.  She successfully navigated the cursor to the
icon, picked up the mouse to eye level, looked at the button she wanted to
click, clicked it, and asked, "Did I do it right?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I turned my computer on, and now there's this white
 arrow on my screen."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "A white arrow?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, it's a small white arrow with black borders."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Oh, that's your mouse cursor. That's normal."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh.  What's it doing there?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, you use your mouse to move that around and click on things."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Um....  What's my mouse?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Look to the right of the keyboard. There should be
 something like a little box with buttons on it and a wire going to the
 back of your computer."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok, now what?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Move it around."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "The arrow moved!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Some years ago, I was watching <em>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</em>.
During the scene where Scotty picks up the mouse and speaks into it.  I laughed
my lungs out.  My father looked at me, slightly confused, and said, "What's so
funny?  Is it inoperative?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't do this button right."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Come again?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't do this button on the screen.  It says I
 have to click on this button, but I can't seem to figure it right."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ma'am, exactly how are you trying to click on the screen?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I'm pressing the button on the screen with the mouse thing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Wait a second -- are you touching the screen?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Of course!  I'm pressing the mouse thing on the button!"
</ul><p>
The client was physically touching the screen with the mouse.  I had her
put her poor mouse down onto its mouse pad and vainly tried to explain
to her the relationship between mouse and cursor.  She didn't get it. 
It was like a video game that was too hard for her.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Move the cursor onto the button that says 'Next'."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok...ok...come on, move over there...come on come on
 comeoncomeoncomeon...DAMMIT, I went past it!  Ok, get back there,
 come on you stupid thing...come one...OK!  OK, I GOT IT ON THERE!
 IT'S ON THE BUTTON!!!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  <em>(face in hands)</em>  "Now press
 the button on the mouse.
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Nothing happens."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Are you pressing the right button or the left button?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "How am I supposed to know which one is the right one to press?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Not right as in 'correct;' right as in 'the
 opposite of left.'"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh.  Yes, I'm pressing the right one."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "You need to press the left one."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "But I'm left-handed, and I want to press the other one."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I need to know how much space is left on my disk drive."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Just right click on your C: drive and choose
 'Properties,' and it will show you how much space you have left."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't do that!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sure you can. All you have to do is right click--"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "You don't understand. I don't right click!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "You mean you can't?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I refuse to right click!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: ?
</ul><p>
Every time this customer calls back, he repeats his stance that despite
the fact that he has two mouse buttons, he does not right click.
<p><hr><p>
I had designed a program in VisualBasic which, at several points, comes up with
a dialog box and requires the user to hit one of two buttons to make a
selection (they look like the familiar "Ok" and "Cancel" buttons).
<p>
A particularly bright Ph.D. beta tested the program for me.  She came to my
office and said that it didn't work.  I followed her to the terminal, and she
showed me how clicking the mouse buttons wasn't doing anything.  She had
misunderstood the words "click on the button which corresponds to your choice"
and thought that the left mouse button corresponded to the left choice, and
the right mouse button corresponded to the right choice.  So the mouse cursor
wasn't over my dialog buttons at all, and she was clicking madly somewhere
else on the screen.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "First I mouse over to 'search' then mouse down and
 type what I'm searching for, then mouse over to 'search' again."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Please right-click on the icon."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "But I'm left handed."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Use the right button to click on the shortcut--"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't have a right button."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You should have a right button."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm sure.  I have 'ctrl', 'alt', 'backspace'..."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One customer complained that her mouse was hard to control with the dust
cover on it.  The dust cover turned out to be the plastic bag in which the
mouse was packaged.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I move the mouse in any direction and the cursor only
 moves an inch or so on the screen and stops."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Take the foam shipping ring out from around the
 mouse ball."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I had a guy call up and say his mouse didn't work with AOL.  Come to find
out, he had installed his mouse <em>inside</em> his computer.  I don't know
how he did that or why he thought it was a good idea -- and I'm not so sure
I want to.
<p><hr><p>
An exasperated caller said she couldn't get her new computer to turn on.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I've pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Foot pedal?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, this little white foot pedal with the on switch."
</ul>
The foot pedal turned out to be the mouse.
<p><hr><p>
Overheard in a computer shop:
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I'd like a mouse mat, please."
<li><b>Salesperson:</b>  "Certainly sir, we've got a large variety."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "But will they be compatible with my computer?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One particular day like any other, an older woman purchased a
Macintosh and dragged it home.  A little while later we received an
angry phone call from the woman.  Apparently, she had set her whole
system up without incident until she came across the mouse pad we
included at no extra charge.  "Which side," she demanded, "of the
mouse pad faces upwards???"  Despite the brightly colored red
company logo emblazoned on one side of the pad, the woman scolded
us for not including appropriate instructions.
<p><hr><p>
Most people figure out that a PC mouse has either two or three buttons on it,
allowing one to left click or right click the mouse.  This has escaped some
individuals when the wheel button was invented.  When I ask customers to
left click the mouse, several have exclaimed to me, "I can't left click
you stupid idiot!  This mouse only has one round button in the middle!"
<p><hr><p>
I was talking to an older guy who made a point of telling me he was
computer illiterate.  (Surprise!)  I made sure that I was spoke very
clearly and in great detail.  We were attempting to check some
information in Dial-Up Networking.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, please double click on 'My Computer' and
 when that window opens, you will see more icons.  Let me know when you get there."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok, I think I can do that."
</ul><p>
I hear clicking noises for at least thirty seconds.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Are you in 'My Computer' yet?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Almost."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok, I've got it.  I'm in that 'My Computer' thing.
 I was just having problems clicking it twice.  This isn't as easy as I thought."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "All right, now please look at the icons listed and
 tell me if you see one that says 'Dial-Up Networking'."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh yes, I see it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "I want you to do the same thing.  Double click on
 the icon that says 'Dial-Up Networking'.  Then let me know when you
 have that screen open, ok?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok."
</ul><p>
Once again there is a far more clicking than is necessary.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "All right, I've got this open but I hope I don't have
 to do that clicking again."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, I'm sorry but a lot of work that's done on
 the computer involves clicking on things.  You will get better with practice."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hmph."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Now. You will see one icon that says 'Make New
 Connection' and another that has <em>[our ISP's name]</em>.  Do you see that?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, I see it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Please RIGHT mouse click ONCE...only ONCE...you
 right mouse click once on <em>[ISP's name]</em>, and you will get a
 drop down menu.  From this menu you will LEFT mouse click ONCE on the
 selection that says 'Properties'.  It will be the last one on the list."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh, I can't do that."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What can't you do?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't right mouse click on anything because my mouse
 doesn't have a right button."
</ul><p>
This stopped me dead.  What kind of mouse could this guy have?
It couldn't have been a Mac mouse, because there would be no way it would
have worked with a PC.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Everyone has at least two buttons on the
 mouse.  Some have three, but you should have at least two.  Look at
 your mouse and tell me how many buttons there are."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It has two buttons, but they are both left buttons."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Umm...well they can't <em>both</em> be left buttons.
 One of them must be a left button, and one must be a right button."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Nope.  I'm telling you, this mouse has two left buttons."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok.  Just click on the right left mouse button."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I worked as a computer teacher's assistant at college level school
(in my city). It was a beginners' course, so I expected many of the
students to know nothing or very little. The biggest misunderstanding
was how the mouse functioned.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Student</b>: "Can you please help me?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Sure, what seems to be the problem?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "I can't seem to make the menu to work."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Use your mouse to activate the menu."
<li><b>Student</b>: "What's a mouse."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Remember this thing?" <em>(I pointed toward it.)</em>
<li><b>Student</b>: "I don't want to touch it."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Why not?"
<li><b>Student</b>: "You said it's a mouse."
</ul><p>
In a different class, I started one of the sessions by saying, "Today I'm going
to help you learn how to use the mouse."  Many of the women jumped up from
their seats and looked nervous.
<p><hr><p>
The DOS version of our product requires the installation of a DOS-based
mouse driver.  Our technical support department received a call from someone
at Walt Disney World who said they didn't have a DOS-based mouse driver.
We had her install a DOS-based mouse driver and started her on the successful
road to installation.  Yes, now we can truthfully say we helped Disney with
their "mouse problem."
