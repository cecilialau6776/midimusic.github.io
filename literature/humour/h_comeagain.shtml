<H3>5.1 Come Again?</H3>
<blockquote>
<h4>Sometimes, especially when conversing on the phone, people
misunderstand each other.  Sometimes it's funny.  Sometimes
it's frustrating.</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, why don't you turn off error control and see
 if that clears the problem up."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Turn off AIR control?  What the heck is AIR control??"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
An instructor in the BASIC programming language was teaching his class how to
write a simple program and execute it.  When each student had all their program
steps keyed in, he told the class to type R-U-N and enter.  A lady in the back
of the class said that it didn't work.  It turned out, when the instructor
had said to type R-U-N, she had typed, "are you in."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Customer Support, this is David, may I help you?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Hello, yes, it's me."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Oh, it's me too." <em>[chuckle]</em>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No, Esmie.  E, s, m, i, e."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Oh, sorry."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Type 'fix' with an 'f'."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Is that 'f' as in 'fix'?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Do you have 3 1/2 inch diskettes?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, I only have 3 of them."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Type 'A' and press Enter."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Didn't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What did it do?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Hmmm...I'll send you a new set of diskettes."
</ul><p>
The problem happened again.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Hmmm...send me the diskettes back."
</ul><p>
They ran perfectly on my machine.  I had her print her config.sys and
autoexec.bat files, etc.  No problems.  I called her back.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Type 'A' and press Enter."
</ul><p>
In the background, faintly, I heard these "tickety-tickety" sounds.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What are you doing?"
</ul><p>
It turned out she was typing, "Type A and press Enter."  The error message
at the bottom of the screen apparently didn't count as "doing anything."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I need you to right-click on the Open Desktop."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did you get a pop-up menu?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok. Right click again. Do you see a pop-up menu?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, sir. Can you tell me what you have done up until this point?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Sure, you told me to write 'click' and I wrote 'click'."
</ul><p>
(At this point I had to put the caller on hold to tell the rest of the tech
support staff what had happened.  I couldn't, however, stop from giggling when
I got back to the call.)<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, did you type 'click' with the keyboard?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I have done something dumb, right?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Click on 'cancel'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "'Capital'?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "'Cancel'!"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It only says 'ok' and 'cancel'."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It tries to log in and then gives this error number.
 I forget what it was...uhm...six one something?  Or was it seven...?
 Four something? Or was it--"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok. Open up 'Dial-Up Networking'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok. I double clicked on the icon on my desktop. It's now dialing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No sir. Click on 'cancel'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What? There's nothing here that says 'connect'.
 There's just a 'cancel' button."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Click on 'cancel' please!"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, now it says it couldn't connect due to an error..."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Click on 'ok' please."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "...of type 619. I can't click on 'cancel'. There is an 'ok' button."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(sigh)</em> "Click on 'ok' then."
</ul>

I was showing a new user how to change her password. She was
typing the new one in slowly and said to me, "I hope you're not
reading my password." I replied that I was the system administrator
and didn't need her password.  She replied, "That's good to know.
I wouldn't want you accessing my stuff."
<p><hr><p>
I work for an ISP. After two calls totaling 45 minutes with
one customer, I asked him to bring his computer in and I would
configure it myself. He was a bit skeptical, so I assured him that he did
not have to bring in the whole computer, just the CPU -- no monitor, cables,
mouse or keyboard, just the CPU. He was not sure which part was the CPU, so
I told him, "Just bring in the box -- the part with the CD-ROM drive and
floppy drive."  I explained this twice.  Later he arrived with the
cardboard box that his computer came in. I asked him where
the computer was, he replied, "I thought you just needed to look at the box
to see what model it was."
<p><hr><p>
A lady struck up a conversation with me on an airplane.
<ul>
<li><b>Her:</b>  "And where are you going?"
<li><b>Me:</b>  "I'm going to San Francisco to a UNIX convention."
<li><b>Her:</b>  "Eunuchs convention?  I didn't know there were that many of you."
</ul>

I'm working as a tech support person at a Finnish newspaper
printing and publication house, and we have several reporters
that submit their files via a dial-in modem line directly to
our layout system.
<p>
Once one of the reporters wanted to call the tech support
because the modem wasn't answering his calls, but the call was
answered by a computer illiterate.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Reporter</b>:  "It seems that...eh, modem's out again."
<li><b>Computer Illiterate</b>: "Oh, just a minute. I'll go look for him."
</ul><p>
He proceeded to page the whole company through the central P.A.
system.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Computer Illiterate</b>:  "Mr. Modem, Mr. Modem, there's a call for you."
</ul><p>
My co-worker intercepts, trying hard to keep a straight face.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Co-Worker</b>:  "Mr. Modem is on vacation.  He won't be back till August."
</ul><p>
The computer illiterate returns to the phone and tells the reporter that our
modem is on vacation till August.
<p><hr><p>
This happened to me several years ago.  The phone rang and I picked
it up.  It was my wife, Kitty, on the other end.  She informed me
that she was having problems printing out a report on the computer.  The
system was locked up and would not respond to the keyboard or the mouse.
<p>
I told her reboot the system.  She did.  I heard the printer go through the
startup cycle.  I asked her to describe what the computer was doing.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Her</b>:  "The computer is on, the monitor light is on, and the printer is on!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "What is on the screen?"
<li><b>Her</b>: "A box with the instruction: install Kickstart 2.0x."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Kickstart?  When did we get an Amiga?"
<li><b>Her</b>: "About six months ago?  What's the problem?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "We have an Atari, and we've had it for 18 months."
<li><b>Her</b>: "What???"  <em>(high pitched squeak)</em>  "Sorry, wrong
 number!"  <em>(click)</em>
