<H3>5.7 Calls From Hell</H3>
<blockquote>
<h4>These are the calls from people without a clue.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I have just received your software, but I have these
 plastic things, what are they?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Could you describe them please?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "They are black plastic, thin, and square."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Anything else?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "They have a metal bit on one edge."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Disks?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I don't know, do I? I just brought your package.
 What do I do with them?"
</ul><p>
I see a horrible call ahead, and the customer is quite irate already.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Put the disks in the drive."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What's a drive?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "The slot in your machine that looks just the right
 size for the disk."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Which machine?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you have a hard drive?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I have two boxes.  One has a picture on it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Put the first disk in, metal side first."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok. It's gone in."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Go to the 'start' button, then run, then type 'setup'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My computer isn't on. How do I turn it on?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Push the button by the drive to eject the disk,
 and press the button that says 'power' on the machine without the
 pictures on it."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok. Done."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Now put in the disk, go to start, run, and type 'setup'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, it's all working now. Thanks, but your software
 isn't very easy to use, is it?"
</ul>

A former professor of mine was receiving a Javascript error when trying
to view a particular web page.  In trying to determine why he was having the
trouble I asked what browser he was using.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "You may have an older browser.  What browser are you using?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Well, I don't have a brand new computer, but it's not
 obsolete. I have Pentium 233 with 64 of the big ones."
<li><b>Me</b>: "You mean 64 megs of RAM?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Yeah, RAM."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok, but what browser are you using? Internet Explorer or Netscape?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "I have Windows 95."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok, that's the operating system. What do you use to look at a web site?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Oh, I'm using Office 97."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Yes, but what browser? When you look at a web site, what
 program do you use?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Office 97."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Office 97 isn't a browser though. When you double click on
 the icon to connect to the Internet, it opens a program that lets
 you look at web sites on the Internet. What program opens? Internet
 Explorer or Netscape?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "My computer is not obsolete. I have Pentium 233."
</ul><p>
I never did find out what browser he uses.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'll have you know, I've never even <em>seen</em>
 a computer before yesterday."
</ul><p>
Great.  Great start to a call.  He wanted to install the Internet connection
software we have, so I had him insert the CD.  "It ain't workin'!" was all I
heard for about two minutes of trying the drive and checking to see if it was
really there.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, could you eject your CD for a moment?  We need
 to check if it's scratched."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Look on the bottom of the CD, and see if there are
 any scratches on it."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "On the bottom?  Shouldn't we check the top?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is the shiny side of the CD on the top?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Of course."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, could you flip it over so the shiny side is
 down and then insert it into the drive?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Won't it scratch if I put it in like that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, it won't scratch."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, ok...."
</ul><p>
He inserted the CD in the drive correctly, and then his computer froze.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My computer froze!  I told you it would scratch the CD!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I'm sure that's not the problem--"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't believe you scratched the CD."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, sir, could you hold down 'ctrl' and 'alt',
 and then-- <em>(clunking sounds)</em>  Hello?  Hello, sir?"
</ul><p>
There was no one on the line for a moment.  Then he spoke up again.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I've been holding 'ctrl' and 'alt' for the past two
 minutes, and nothing is happening at all on my whole damn computer,
 because you made me scratch the software."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My program doesn't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Which program are you using?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "The one I use to get my work done."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ma'am, we support many different programs, what's
 the name of the program you use?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't know; it's the one that comes up when I start my computer."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Can you tell me what you see on the screen after
 you start your computer?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, I can't get the program to come up so I can't tell
 you what's on the screen."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is your computer on?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Of course it's on!  I know how to turn on my computer!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What kind of computer do you have?  Is it a PC,
 a Macintosh, an Xterminal, or a VT420?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't know. You're the help desk -- you're supposed
 to know that."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Uh.  Have you tried rebooting your machine?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(angrily)</em> "I just told you I can't get the
 program to run. What kind of help desk is this?  I don't think you're
 very helpful, and I'll have you know that I personally know one of
 the programmers, and I'm going to call her since I know <em>she'll</em>
 be able to help me!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
This woman calls in, having a problem with her video card.  Her initial rundown
on the situation seems like she would know what she was talking about.  But
no.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "So when I go to boot my computer, it just does nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "It just does nothing?  So, when you turn on your
 computer you just get a blank screen?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh no, It comes up and counts my memory, detects hard drives, etc."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, then what happens?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It doesn't do nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "It doesn't do nothing?  I am not sure I understand.
 Does it lock up at this point?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh no, after that I get the screen with the clouds that
 says 'Windows' on it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, so you turn it on, it starts to boot up, then
 it goes to the splash screen with the clouds, and this is where you
 are having problems?  What happens here?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It doesn't do nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, so can you even get in to Windows?  Will the
 system boot to your desktop?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "All right, so, you turn on your system, it counts
 your RAM, detects your drives, loads the splash screen, boots into
 Windows, and then what?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "So what is the problem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "The computer doesn't do nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, I need you to be a little more specific here
 because that so far, this is quite normal."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh yeah, all that stuff is normal."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "So again, what is the problem anyway?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My desktop is all washed out looking."
</ul>

I sent a JPEG from my recent vacation to my mother as an email
attachment. I then telephoned her to see if she was able to view it.
After attempting to get her to use the 'File/Open' command in Netscape, I
realized that my 'Open' dialog was different from hers, and so I couldn't
talk her through it. But I tried to determine which OS she was running.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Do you know what operating system you're running? Is it
 Windows 95 or Windows 3.1?"
<li><b>My Mother</b>: "I don't know, but it must be Windows 95."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok, do you see a 'My Computer' icon on your screen?"
<li><b>My Mother</b>: "'My Computer'? What's that?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "It's a picture of a computer with the words 'My Computer' underneath it."
<li><b>My Mother</b>: "I don't have that."
<li><b>Me</b>: "It would be on the desktop."
<li><b>My Mother</b>: <em>(getting irate)</em> "I don't know what you're talking about."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Mom, tell me what you see when you turn your computer on."
<li><b>My Mother</b>: "Nothing."
<li><b>Me</b>: "You don't see anything? No words appear on the screen?
 Nothing? Well, what do you see on your screen right now?"
<li><b>My Mother</b>: "I don't see anything."
<li><b>Me</b>: <em>(getting frustrated)</em> "You're staring at a black
 screen? There's nothing there at all?"
<li><b>My Mother</b>: "I'm not technical. I don't know these things."
<li><b>Me</b>: "I just want you to describe what you see."
<li><b>My Mother</b>: "I don't see anything. I just get on here and
 clickity-click."
<li><b>Me</b>: "I gotta go, Mom."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
We have one customer who is notorious in the tech support department.
We all dread getting a call from her. She is truly stupid when it comes
to a computer.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, you are in <kbd>C:\WINDOWS</kbd>.
 We need to get to the <em>A:</em> drive. So type 'A' colon and press enter."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "'A'? What's an 'A'?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "It's the first letter of the alphabet. 'A' like apple."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ummm...what's an 'A'? I don't know what it is."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Grade school, remember? The letter 'A'?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, ok. Where is that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Left side of the keyboard. Next to the 'S'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok...I think I found it. What do I do?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Press it. See what happens."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok, I've got an 'A' now."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Now press the colon.  It's next to the 'L' key."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "How do I get it?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hold down the 'shift' key."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "How to you spell that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "S-H-I-F-T. You have two of them. Near the
 space bar. Hold that down and press the colon."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't find the colon."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "It's to the right of the 'L'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "How do I get it?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hold the shift key and press the colon key."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, ok...I think I've got it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Good, now hit 'enter'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Where's that?"
</ul><p>
This whole conversation of two commands took almost an hour. I have no
idea how this lady ever made enough money to buy a computer.
It amazes me how someone can forget the <em>alphabet</em>.  She's nice,
but she's amazingly dumb.
<p><hr><p>
A customer wanted to set up his computer to download something from the
Internet.  So I spent a nice chunk of time walking him through downloading
Netscape and the Plugin Pack and rebooting.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "So are we done yet?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Not yet."
</ul><p>
I spent still more time configuring TCP/IP for the LAN for him.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "So are we done yet?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Not yet."
</ul><p>
I spent still more time with him configuring access through the firewall and
setting his preferences.  Netscape started fine at this point.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "So are we done yet?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes.  Try accessing the site now."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "How do I do that?"
</ul><p>
I spent still more time with him explaining how to enter a URL.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It's not working!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Where are you trying to go?"
</ul><p>
He gave me the address.  I tried <em>nslookup</em> and <em>whois</em> on it,
but they came up empty.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I'm sorry, that site doesn't exist.  Are you sure
 you wrote it down correctly?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well! All this was a waste of time! We've accomplished
 nothing!" <em>(click)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A customer called complaining that his display wasn't working.  (It turned out
to be that his monitor was out of sync.)<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I installed the video drivers and all I see is a
 postage stamp in the center of the screen."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Can you describe what you see?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I just told you, a postage stamp!!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Does it look like your desktop?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Nope. Aren't you listening?? It looks like a postage stamp."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok,let's reset the system back to VGA."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What's that??"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "The default video settings...please hit Ctrl-Alt-Delete."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What is that???"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "The three keys. 'Control' and 'Alt' and 'Delete'
 pressed at the same time."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, ok.  Oh no!!  My screen went blank!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "That's ok.  When you see OS/2 in the upper left hit 'Alt' and 'F1'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "'Alt'?  'F1'?  Can you speak English?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, these are keys on your keyboard."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(waits a minute for the system to finish
 booting)</em> "Do you see the OS/2 logo yet?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Nope."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(waits another minute or two)</em> "Anything yet?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Nope.  Can I release the keys?"
</ul><p>
Twenty minutes later I found out he had a monitor that was only capable of
VGA, and then I spent another ten minutes trying to explain why he needed a
better monitor to display higher resolutions.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Double click on 'My Computer', then on the 'Dial-up Networking' folder."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Where is it?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Excuse me?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Where is 'My Computer'?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "In the upper left corner of your screen."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh! Hey! That's pretty good!!"
</ul><p>
Twenty five minutes later....<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, now go to 'Options' and then 'Mail and News Preferences'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Got it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Now click on the tab that says 'Servers'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't see it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What do you see on your screen?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh! There it is. I was looking on the keyboard."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, now read to me what's in the SMTP field."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "There's nothing there."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Now we know why you can't get your mail. Type
 in 'mailhost.worldnet.att.net'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "M-A-L-E-H-O-S-T..."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No sir. It's spelled M-A-I-L-H-O-S-T."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok...where's the dot?"
</ul><p>
I wanted to cry.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Husband</b>: "Hi. I'm having a problem connecting to the Internet."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok sir, what operating system are you using?"
<li><b>Husband</b>: "Oh...I'm really not sure...I'm not the computer expert.
 My wife is. She's sitting at the computer. I'm going to dictate this
 to her." <em>(pause)</em> "She says we use Windows 95."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok. What exactly is the problem?"
<li><b>Husband</b>: "I can't connect."
<li><b>Wife</b>: <em>(in the background)</em> "We can't even get
 on -- the software is buggy!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, what happens when you try to connect?"
<li><b>Husband</b>: "Ok, the <em>Connect To:</em> screen pops up, and it
 asks for my password."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did you put your password in?"
<li><b>Husband</b>: "Yes, and it keeps asking for it afterwards."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you have your caps lock key on?"
<li><b>Husband</b>: "Yes, but that shouldn't make any difference."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Uhm...go ahead and hit the caps lock key until the
 light goes away."
<li><b>Husband</b>: "Are you sure? We've always got on with the caps lock key on."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, I'm sure."
<li><b>Husband</b>: "Oh, ok. It took my password."
<li><b>Wife</b>: <em>(in the background)</em> "I told you!"
 <em>(They start arguing.  She takes the phone from him.)</em>  "HELLO?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, hello, you should be all set from here."
<li><b>Wife</b>: "YES HI, I'VE BEEN USING YOUR DAMN SOFTWARE FOR
 I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW LONG, AND I STILL CAN'T GET EMAIL FROM MY SON IN THE NAVY!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What program do you use for email, ma'am?"
<li><b>Wife</b>: "I use Windows 95! We already told you that!"
<li><b>Husband</b>: <em>(in the background)</em> "We already told her that, didn't we?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, what mail application...such as Eudora,
 Netscape, Internet Explorer..."
<li><b>Wife</b>: "Microsoft Netscape."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Netscape?"
<li><b>Wife</b>: "Yes, Microsoft Netscape."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, open that up and go to <em>Options</em>, and
 then <em>Mail and News Preferences</em>--"
<li><b>Wife</b>: "No, I want email! I don't want to surf the net!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Netscape comes with an email program, and we're
 going to set it up now."
<li><b>Wife</b>: "Ugh. Fine. Whatever. We'll do it YOUR way."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok." <em>(explains how to set up popmail)</em>
<li><b>Wife</b>: "I'm not getting mail."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you have two phone lines?"
</ul><p>
Suddenly I hear the modem attempting to dial in.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(over the roar of the modem)</em> "MA'AM? YOU
 ONLY HAVE ONE PHONE LINE. DON'T TRY TO DIAL IN."
</ul><p>
<em>(beep click click)</em><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You can't dial up with this line. It's already in use."
<li><b>Wife</b>: "I was always able to use it before YOU changed my settings!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, you will just have to disconn--"
<li><b>Wife</b>: "You tech support people always mess up my settings, and
 then I have to bring my computer back to <em>[retailer]</em> to
 get it fixed! You know, you cost me so much money!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ma'am, I didn't change any of your Internet settings."
<li><b>Wife</b>: "Yes you did, we just went through a NUMBER of things."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "All we did was--"
<li><b>Wife</b>: "I've had ENOUGH of your service. I'm going back
 to AOL." <em>(click)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I got a call from an older lady who
stated that after installing our software, her mouse would not work.
After further questioning, I learned that she got a message when
booting the system that a device was not found. I had her power off the
PC, disconnect, and then reconnect the mouse. After rebooting, the mouse
functioned fine. But instead of thanking me, she asked me sourly,
"Why did your software unplug my mouse?" I attempted to explain to the lady
that that was not possible and that all it waswas a loose connection.  It
wasn't good enough for her.  She put her husband on, who asked, "Why did your
software decide my computer didn't need a mouse?"  Again, trying to explain
the loose connection was of little use, and he wanted another number to call
to return the software.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "So the mouse won't move?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Does the numlock or capslock work?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, you'll need to hit the reset button."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Is the system booting back up yet?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ummm..."  <em>(pause)</em>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Is it rebooting?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I see a return button.  Is that the one you want?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "No, the reset button.  It's on the front of the
 computer.  You're looking at the keyboard."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh, umm...there's just one button, and it says 'power'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "That's the monitor.  The computer is that box
 that all those things plug into."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Umm...ohh!  I see it now -- how silly of me.  Ok, I pressed it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Is the system rebooting now?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, it's still locked up."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "You're sure you pressed the button marked 'reset'?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, it's right here next to the one labeled 'Form Feed'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ma'am, that's the printer."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Maybe you just need to come here and fix it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ma'am, do you use any floppy disks?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, I save all my letters on them."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "The computer is the thing you stick the disks into."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "OHHH!!!!  It's under the desk...hang on.  Well!
 Look at that; there's a reset button.  I pressed it, now my computer
 is acting like I just turned it on."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, good."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Wait, what's this button that says 'Turbo'?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "That's there so you can slow the system down to
 run older software and games."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Is that why my system is so slow?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Is the yellow light on?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Press that button."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "WOW!!!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My report didn't freeze up this time."
</ul><p>
That turned out to be the cause of her system locking up.  It wasn't really
locking up, it was just going so slow it seemed that way, and she never
waited long enough for it to finish processing her reports.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "When I dial your service, the system asks me some
 questions and then it kicks me off."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What were the questions that it asked you?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't remember."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, sir, if you don't remember what they were, I
 don't know what the problem is and I can't help you."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "So I need to call you and go through this again after
 seeing the questions again?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Can't I just keep you on while I call?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Is your modem on another line?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No, same line."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, sir, you can't do it...it's like someone
 picking up the phone now and dialing while we are talking."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Can I at least try?"
</ul>
He tried.  Twice.  Ugh.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My Internet doesn't work!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, do you have an icon for Internet on your desktop?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "An icon? Desktop??"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Are you using Windows 95?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Don't know. You said Windows???  By the way, how do
 you type a capital 'e' instead of a lower case 'e'?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(crying)</em> "Hold 'shift' while pressing 'e'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What is 'shift'??"

<li><b>Customer</b>: "My modem is not working."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok.  Let's start simply.  Do you have a phone line
 running from the back of the computer to the wall?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I have no dial tone when I pick up the phone."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you have a phone line running from the back of
 the computer to the wall?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I bought this new computer, it's got <em>(reads from
 store receipt)</em> and 32 megs of RAM.  But it won't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok.  Tell me how you have it set up right now."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I have it setting next to the phone, and the
 phone line is hooked into it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is anything running into the wall?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "So you have the computer sitting next to the
 phone, the phone line running into the computer, and that's it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes.  Am I supposed to plug the computer in?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, it needs to be plugged in so the modem can dial."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What's a modem?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
My boss sent an update of our current program via modem to
all of our online customers, with instructions to call in and be walked
through the upgrade if they needed it. He had to leave the office for a
few hours, so he gave me instructions on how to start the upgrade once
they had downloaded it.
<p>
I got a call while he was away.  Details you should know:  the lady who
called me for instructions was not the person who was operating the computer.
That person was on the other side of the room, and everything had to be
relayed through the lady on the phone.  For reasons of brevity, I won't
bother typing out every sentence being repeated several times back and
forth.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "We got your program, along with a note that we were
 supposed to call...?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, I can help you with that.  Type
 <em>[the command]</em> and press Return."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "It says that file doesn't exist."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Huh?  Ok...are you in the <em>[directory]</em> directory?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Hmmm.  Let's try this again, just to be sure."
</ul><p>
I spelled out the command exactly and got her to read it back to me before
she hit Return.  But she got the same error.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "All right, let's make sure the program is installed
 in the right directory.  Could you take a look in the directory tree
 and let me know what you find in--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Tree?  TREE??  There's no trees anywhere near my
 computer!  Whaddaya mean a tree might have caused the problem???"
</ul><p>
Needless to say, that took a while to straighten out.  Anyway, it turned out
the upgrade wasn't in the directory at all.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Did you receive the program OK?  No error messages
 or anything popped up during the transmission?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh no, everything went fine.  I've got it right here in my hand."
</ul><p>
Sigh.  Someone had transferred the download to disk in order to install it
on a second computer, handed it to her, and told her to call us.  Apparently
it never occurred to her to get the program on the computer somehow before
calling.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What do you have connected to the back of your computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I have a printer, a modem and the System 7 module."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Excuse me, but could you repeat the last item?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "The System 7 module."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "The System 7 what?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It's the module to upgrade the system to 7.5."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "...and it plugs into the back of your computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Does this 'module' plug into anything else?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It plugs into the wall outlet."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ma'am, that's the power cord."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No, I can see the power cord, and this module is
 plugged in right next to it."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ma'am, there is no such thing as a System 7 module."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh my goodness, I'm sorry, I forgot.  It's the power
 supply to the HyperCard."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ma'am, HyperCard does not have a separate power
 supply.  Would you mind following the cord from the outlet
 until you find what it plugs into?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok."
</ul>
Ten minutes later...
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It hooks into the printer."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
This call took more than 45 minutes, in case you wanted to know why there
are hold times on support numbers.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I haven't had sound for about a month."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What kind of speakers do you have?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "They are stereo."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, do they plug into the wall?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "So they are the little boxes that don't attach to the monitor?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  <em>[angrily]</em>  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, let's see if maybe the speakers are the
 problem.  Do you have a music CD?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Would you go get it?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Sure."  <em>[clunk clunk clunk]</em>  "Do you want
 one that came with the computer?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, I need a music CD."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I think 'The Animals' has music."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, maybe I am being unclear, I need a regular CD
 not a cdrom -- one you buy at a music store."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I have a Garth Brooks CD, but I bought it at a swap meet."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "That's great; that CD will work."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I go to swap meets all the time to get great deals on
 stuff.  We don't ever go to the music stores."
</ul>
We get the CD playing with AudioStation, but there's no sound.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, let's check the volume."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I already checked the damn volume when it stopped
 making sound a month ago!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "I understand.  Let's just double check it real quick."
</ul>
The volume level turns out ok, and the sound's not muted.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I'll just turn it all the way up....  Nope, can't hear a damn thing."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "It looks like you are ok there, now let's check those speakers."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, but you might as well replace the whole damn thing right now."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "I'll be happy to replace anything that needs
 replacing.  I just want to make sure we get everything working for you."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "All right."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Now those speakers...they are all hooked up?  The
 left connects to the right and then the right connects to the computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  <em>[obviously without checking]</em>  "Yup."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok.  And they are turned off right?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "...Listen to me you little..."
</ul>
I endure a three minute profanity/threat combo.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "...Of course they are turned on!!  Now you--"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Whoa, slow down a sec...I <em>want</em>
 you to turn them to the off position, please."
</ul>
Country music blares.  The rest of the conversation takes place shouting over it.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Heck son, I don't believe it!  What was the problem?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "The batteries must be dead."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I used to work as a salesman for a computer wholesaler a number of
years ago.  I got a call from a woman who was fit to be tied.  She
found out that the person who sold her the computer bought it from our
company and called us to complain.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I need help with this computer!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well what do you need to know?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(screaming)</em>  "Well I bought this damn computer
 from this guy who says he bought it from you and he came to my house
 and hooked it up. Now while he's explaining to my daughter how to use
 it, she's telling him 'yeah, yeah,' she knows what he's talking
 about.  I'm in the kitchen cooking peppers and onions while my
 daughter is going 'yeah, yeah,' then this guy leaves, and I ask my
 daughter if she knows how to use the computer, and she says she was
 too embarrassed to tell him she didn't understand and just told him
 'yeah, yeah.'  Now I paid over $1000 for this thing and I don't even
 know how to use it!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Uh, well is there anything in particular you
 want to know how to do?"
</ul><p>
I never anticipated her answer.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I wanna make a tennis game."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "A what!?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "A tennis game with the paddles."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What, you mean like pong?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, tennis!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "You mean with graphics?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I wanna make a tennis game with the, you know, rackets
 and the ball."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  <em>(in shock, I start blurting nonsense)</em>
 "Well, do you know Windows?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I don't know anything about computers, I was frying
 sausages in the kitchen..."
</ul><p>
She tells me the whole story again.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, you would need to lean how to program in a
 computer language like C++ and that takes many years of experience.
 I'd suggest you first start slowly and learn DOS and Windows."
</ul><p>
After that, I spent twenty minutes talking her down from a seething boil
to a cool simmer and finally got her off the phone.  I imagine this
woman aggravated the poor slob who sold her the computer until he caved in
and gave her our number.  Nice guy.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Look, look!!!!!  Look what it's doing!!!  Can you
 BELIEVE this??  Why is it doing that??"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Sir, I can't see your computer, what is it doing?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "WHAT???  Can't you figure it out?? LOOK AT MY COMPUTER
 SCREEN!!!!!  You can see it, can't you?!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
This was my slowest caller ever:
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Thank you for calling; how may I help you?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ummm...it doesn't work."
</ul>
Direct and to the point, but just a touch vague.  So I prodded him for more
information about his problem.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What does not work?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ummm...the program doesn't work."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Could you please be more specific?  Was there an error message?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes."
</ul>
I waited a moment, thinking that he would continue on his own.  But he didn't.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "And the message was?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Something about a GPF."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Are you in front of the computer now?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Can you get in front of the computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I guess; let me get out of bed."
</ul>
Shuffling.  Stepping down stairs.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Are you still there?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yeah, I have to go downstairs and turn on the computer."
</ul>
This guy has a 386-25 with 2 megs of RAM loading Windows.  It takes about
five minutes to boot up his machine.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, are you in Windows?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Uhhhh...almost...."
</ul>
Pause.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, are you in Windows?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Uhhhh...almost...."
</ul>
Pause.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, you are in Windows, can you get into the
 program for me please?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "How do I do that?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Just the way you normally do."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't remember.  It's late, and I'm tired.  Step me through it."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Double click on the icon for the program please."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Where is that?"
</ul>
I slowly drop my head to the desk.  Finally, I get him to start our
application and wait three minutes for the software to load.  I'm now fifteen
minutes into this call, and I normally average three and a half.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, can you duplicate the problem for me?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Uhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmm.........no."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Why not?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't remember where it happened."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "I'm afraid I really won't able to help unless I
 know the error message and where it occured.  You will need to
 recreate the message and call us back with that information."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "But I waited so long to talk to you, you people really
 need to be faster if you expect people to use your service.  It
 takes too long to talk to you.  You will lose customers unless
 you speed it up."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Thanks for calling, bye-bye."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It was working last night, but it's not working any
 longer.  And I haven't changed anything."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "You sure you haven't changed anything?  Nobody's
 gone near the machine?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yeah, yeah, nobody touched it."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What's not working?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I can't get into my POP account."
</ul>
Alarm bells go off in my head.  The user doesn't <em>have</em> a POP account.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Oh.  All right.  Do you have the letter we sent you
 with your POP account details?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yeah, uh, it's...around here somewhere."
 <em>[scrabbling sounds]</em>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, let's forget the POP account for a moment.  Can
 you tell me exactly what happened?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, I moved everything onto my new machine this
 morning, and it's not working."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "I thought you said that you didn't change anything???"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "But I didn't!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, type 'cd windows.'"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Right."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What does it say?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It says 'see colon slash greater-than see dee windows.'"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  <em>[sigh]</em>  "Press return."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, it says 'see colon slash windows slash greater-than.'"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Right, do a dir."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Uh...how?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Type 'dir'."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It says 'see colon slash windows slash greater-than dir.'"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  <em>[adding teethmarks to the phone]</em> "Press return!"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, it says lots of different things, and then, 'see
 colon slash windows slash greater-than.'  Oh, and there's
 always a flashy line after the greater-than; did I mention that?"
</ul>

A user calls from Chicago.  (We are in central Illinois.)  She wants to
register for classes via our online registration system.  In the course of
the discussion I discover that:
<ol>
<li> She is definitely "Not A Computer Person" (tm).
<li> She is at her friend's house, but her friend is not there.
<li> Her friend has a computer, but she doesn't know what kind.
<li> She has never turned it on.
<li> She thinks it has a modem, but she is not sure.
<li> She has never logged on to any of her university accounts.
<li> She has never used any terminal software and doesn't know what
	type her friend has.
</ol>
She was deeply upset that "no one will help her."  Sadly, I was also unable
to do so.  I mean, what do you do?
<p><hr><p>
I once received a call from a woman with a heavy, throaty,
not-real-educated-or-bright voice from New York.  She asked if the...
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "...new tape, ya know, the plasticky thingie I got in
 the mail...does that work even if I don't put it in my compoota??"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, ma'am, the software does not work unless it is
 installed on to your hard drive."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "But this isn't soft...this is a small hard plastic square..."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes, ma'am, that's called software, and you need
 to insert it into the disk drive to use it."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Look, lady, I'm not stupid -- this isn't soft -- and I
 don't appreciate you making fun of me."  <em>[click]</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Now, do you see the words '[etc etc etc]'."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Um, no."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Scroll down, there should be the words
 '[etc etc etc]' enclosed in brackets."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "They're not here."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  <em>[loading up the same file in EDIT on my
 machine]</em> "Ok, starting from the top, you'll see '[this]',
 '[that]', and '[the other]'.  The next section will have
 '[etc etc etc]' in brackets."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh, you mean '[etc etc etc]'!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes.  Now, under that is a blank line."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Now, move the cursor to that blank line."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't understand what you mean."
</ul>
I spent about ten minutes trying to navigate him to the beginning of the
blank line so that he can type in a single line of text.  He seemed to
completely lack comprehension.  The man understood English, but there was
something he seemed to be failing to grasp.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  <em>[getting frustrated and barely keeping
 calm]</em> "Now, right below the words '[etc etc etc]' is a blank line."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh!  You mean the line that doesn't have anything on it!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "YES!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Sir, open up your System Folder and find the
 Launcher Items folder."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't have a Systems Folder."
</ul>
My patience with such customers was wearing thin.  After a short pause:
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "It's in your hard disk, sir.  You must have one,
 or else your computer wouldn't start properly."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Hard disk, hard disk...hmmm -- is that little
 rectangle in the top right?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, but mine doesn't say 'Hard Disk.'  It's just
 labeled with a period.  How did that happen?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, you can name it anything you want, perhaps
 yours was named accidentally."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh.  What now?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Open your System Folder."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't have a systems folder.  Oh, oh, here it is!
 Ok, ok, I'm opening the Systems Envelope now."
</ul>
And after an excruciating 30 minutes of how to make an alias and
reminding him that he truly did have a System Folder (or, as he
called it, an "Envelope") and where it was, we got his new software
on the Launcher.
<p>
Ten minutes later he called me back and told me how he had written
down my directions to the "Systems Envelope" so he could put
more programs on his Launcher.  One of the programs didn't work,
however, and after another 45 minutes of sheer hell, I told him we
needed to send him some new floppies.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Hey, can you send me a dozen apples too? My wife would
 like to make a pie.  Ha ha!  Apples.  Get it?  Macintoshes?
 Ha ha.  Don't you get it?"
</ul>
If I had a button on my phone to administer electro-shock to this
man, I would have.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes sir, I do."

<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I get garbage when I log onto IndyNet."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, what software are you using?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Internet."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes, I know you're connecting to the Internet, but
 what software do you use to make the connection?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh!  Windows."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b> "Yes, but what software inside of Windows do you use?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh!  Ok, yes, I have an Acer 486-66D...."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No!  The software!  Do you know what software is?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Uh, kind of."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok.  Software is the program that you run in order
 to make the computer do anything, ok?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok."

<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, well, I'm having trouble with WordPerfect."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What sort of trouble?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the
 words went away."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Went away?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "They disappeared."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Hmm.  So what does your screen look like now?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Nothing?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It's blank; it won't accept anything when I type."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "How do I tell?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Can you see the C:\&gt; prompt on the screen?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "What's a sea-prompt?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Never mind.  Can you move the cursor around on the screen?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "There isn't any cursor; I told you, it won't accept anything I type."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Does your monitor have a power indicator?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "What's a monitor?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "It's the thing with the screen on it that looks
 like a TV.  Does it have a little light that tells you when it's on?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't know."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, then look on the back of the monitor and
 find where the power cord goes into it.  Can you see that?"
</ul>
(Rustling and jostling heard in the background.)
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  <em>[muffled]</em> "Yes, I think so."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Great!  Follow the cord to the plug and tell me
 if it's plugged into the wall."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, it is."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "When you were behind the monitor, did you notice
 that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, there are.  I need you to look back there
 again and find the other cable."
</ul>
(Rustle, rustle.)
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  <em>[muffled]</em>  "Ok, here it is."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Follow it for me and tell me if it's plugged
 securely into the back of your computer."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  <em>[still muffled]</em>  "I can't reach."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Uh huh.  Well, can you see if it is?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Even if you maybe put your knee on something and
 lean way over?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle --
 it's because it's dark in here."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Dark?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes -- the office light is off, and the only light I
 have is coming in from the window."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, turn on the office light then."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I can't."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No?  Why not?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Because there's a power outage."

<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, no.  What do you see between the bar where it
 says 'Program Manager' and those boxes?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, do you see that white bar underneath the
 Program Manager bar?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Good.  What's on the far left of that bar?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It says 'File.'"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "All right, click on File and select Run."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It's asking me if I want to exit Windows.  Do I click on OK?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Click on Cancel.  Now, click of File and then
 click on <em>Run</em>."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It brought up a box with 'Program Item' and 'Program
 Group' in it.  Which one do you want?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Click on Cancel.  Click on File and hit 'R' on the keyboard."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "There's no 'R' in the list."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "On the keyboard there should be an 'R' key."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh, yes."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Press it."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Now it's asking for a 'Command Line.'"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Good.  Type 'sysedit', s-y-s-e-d-i-t, and hit Enter."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't see Enter.  Do you want me to click on 'OK'?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "That'll work."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It says it couldn't find the file."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Let's try it again: S...Y...S...E...D...I...T."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "S...Y...F...E...C...I...V."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, no.  Sysedit.  As in system editor."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "S...Y...S...T...E...M..."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No.  Just sysedit.  S...Y...S...E...D...I...T."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, that brought up a window with four windows inside it."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Good.  Bring up the system.ini window."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "How do I do that?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Close the first window, the autoexec.bat."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Now close the config.sys window."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I can't.  I guess I closed the wrong window.  The only
 window I have now is Program Manager."
</ul>
Fast forward about five minutes to when Sysedit is finally up and the
system.ini is being displayed.  However, the user is unable to find the
comm.drv line in 14 attempts of going down the list line by line for the
first 12 lines.  The other techs have been listening to this and are almost
on the floor laughing.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, click on Search and select Find."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't see Search."
</ul>
Yep, you guessed it.  Repeat the whole File-&gt;Run routine right down to being
unable to type in "comm" in the search-for line.  Almost 10 minutes more to
find the line -- seventh line down.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What does the line read?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "'comm.drv=rhodsi.drv'"
</ul>
Bingo!  Home stretch now.  Have the user comment out that line and put in
Windows' driver back.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Now exit out of Windows and restart."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Windows won't start.  It says something about a device driver."
</ul>
I'm grateful now for using SysEdit.  Restore the backup SysEdit automatically
makes.  Try changing the line using DOS Edit three times.  Each time is the
same -- device driver error.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Type 'copy system.syd system.ini' and hit Enter."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Type 'win' and hit Enter."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It's starting."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "You should be set then."
