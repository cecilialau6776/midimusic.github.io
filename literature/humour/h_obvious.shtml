As proven many times over the mere presence of a computer can short circuit
normally intelligent people's brains.  But sometimes it's just ridiculous.

<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I've downloaded the video drivers for the PS/VP's

There was a really angry user who called me, saying my company was @#$!#
and its products were !@#$@, and I was @#$*! too.  He said he bought our
graphics card, and it didn't work, and what the @&amp;$!# was I going to do about
it before he sued my lying butt.
<p>
After this I learned from him that he didn't actually <em>have</em> our product.

<li><b>Customer</b>: "How?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Place the disk in the opening at the front of the computer."

A friend has a final examination in English theater.

was in a rush and didn't have time to print it, so I brought it to
her on a diskette.<p>
<ul>

I am a technician for a school system using a Novell network. One day I had
a user call and complain, "Every time I turn off my computer, I lose my
network connection."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>A Friend</b>:  "There's an icon on my desktop that won't go away."

<li><b>Me</b>: "What do you mean?"
<li><b>Friend</b>: "Well, there's something called 'calculator' on the screen.
 What does it do?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "You know the calculator on your desk? It does that."
<li><b>Friend</b>: "Oh. I thought it was a program that acted like a
 calculator or something."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm just about ready to say give me my money back. You
 guys don't help me ever."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What's wrong?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My son said you hooked him up last night, and all I
 needed to do is type in the address in my browser, and it would work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Are you connected when this happens, ma'am?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yeeeessss."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok.  What did you do immediately after you typed in the address?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I waited, and then it disconnected me."

<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hi.  I was using Word, and my PC says it's lost its network connection."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, can you read me the error message?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Er...error message?  Where's that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "It should be on your screen."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Er..."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, can you just tell me what's on your screen?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, in the top-left corner, I've got a little blue
 'W' on a blue bar.  Next to that it says 'Microsoft Word - Document 1.'
 At the other end of the blue bar there are three buttons..."

Once I went out on a service call to fix a customer's PC.  My assistant
handled the call and brought the PC in for repairs.  A day later, I got
a call from the customer.  He said the computer wasn't working.  I asked for
more details, and he said the monitor was dead, and there was no picture on
the screen.
<p>
After a few minutes of trying to figure out what was wrong, I called my
assistant and asked what he did to the customer's computer.  He said, "Nothing.
I still have it right here."
<p><hr><p>
The customer was using release 1 of Windows 95, and I was using Windows 98, so
I had to ask her a question about what her Explorer window looked like.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Up at the top it says <em>File</em>, <em>Edit</em>, and
 <em>View</em>. What does it say just to the right of <em>View</em>?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "<em>Edit</em>."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, to the right of <em>View</em>."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "<em>Edit</em>."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, what's on the other side of <em>View</em>?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, <em>Tools</em>."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Click your left mouse button."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Which one is that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, you know your left from your right, so
 click the button on your left."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What happened?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You did click the left mouse button?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I think so."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "The one on your left?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Which one was that again?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Someone complained that her monitor was "all green."  The problem, I guessed,
was due to the monitor cable not being correctly connected, so that the red
and blue pins weren't making contact.  I talked her through the checking
process, but she was adamant that the cable was correctly plugged in.
<p>
Somewhat puzzled, I decided to visit her office.  Sure enough, the cable
wasn't correctly inserted.  She'd forced it in and bent some pins.  I pointed
it out, and she said with some astonishment, "It wasn't like that a moment
ago!"
<p>
I fixed it, then asked what it had been like before.  She said that the plug
had been a different shape.  I finally figured out what she meant.  She had
been checking the <em>other</em> end of the cable, where it plugs into the
desktop chassis.  I pointed this out to her.
<p>
She said, quote, "Oh!  I didn't know it had two ends!"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm going to be using Windows NT. Should I get the
 Server or Workstation version?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, are you using it as a workstation or as a server?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "A server. So, which one do I get?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "The server version perhaps?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Which one is that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Windows NT Server."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok, thanks."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Giving instructions on how to use Microsoft Word 7:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Type in a few words, or a test sentence."
<li><b>Secretary</b>: <em>(skeptically)</em> "With what?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "The keyboard."
<li><b>Secretary</b>: "The what?!?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Keyboard. The jobbie in front of you with the keys on it."
<li><b>Secretary</b>: "Oh. That."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Yeah, it works like a typewriter."
<li><b>Secretary</b>: "I don't understand.  <em>(types a few words)</em>
 "Oh! Hey! It works just like my typewriter!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Uh-huh..."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Uhh...I need help unpacking my new PC."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What exactly is the problem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't open the box."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, I'd remove the tape holding the box closed
 and go from there."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Uhhhh...ok, thanks...."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I told one of our customers to send an email message to me so I could see
if her mail was working. I told her that my address was mjq@<em>[host]</em>.
She replied, "How do you spell 'mjq'?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "What's a colon?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "It's the key next to the 'L' key on your keyboard."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "How do you spell 'L'?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Type 'A:' at the prompt."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "How do you spell that?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "How long is your 1000-foot bulk cable?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Just call us back if there's a problem. We're open 24 hours."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Is that Eastern time?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Click on the computer icon on the left side of the screen."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Is that your left or my left?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Hello, help desk."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I've just installed PacerLink and it's not working."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What does the screen say?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "'PacerLink is acting as a VT220 terminal.  Press Alt-D
 to dial, or Enter to continue.'"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "And what happens when you press Alt-D?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh...thank you."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It just comes up with a message and says, 'Click OK.' Now what?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Once I was walking a gentleman through the steps to do something -- I don't
even remember what -- and when we finished, a dialog box appeared.  It
offered to do what we wanted it to and had a single button -- the OK button.
<p>
He sat there for a minute and then, frustrated, asked me what he had to do
next.
<p>
"Tell the computer 'OK,'" I said.
<p>
He leaned forward and said in a loud but clear voice, "OK!"<p>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Can I help you?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Let's get something straight right away.  I'm a Mac
 tech, so I know what the hell I'm doing."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok."
</ul>
This caller needed to reinstall fonts; we started the install, and a couple of
minutes later...
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Uh...it's telling me I have to insert disk 2.  What do I do?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Um...insert disk 2?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, now press the right arrow key."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "The bar is going down."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Are you pressing the right arrow key?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, and it's still going down."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Are you sure you're pressing the right arrow key?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, oh, that's the key with the arrow pointing right, isn't it?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Er, yes."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok, another menu has come up."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Once a student had a problem printing.  What was the matter?  "It's not
printing," he said.  So I went to take a look.  On the student's computer,
a message was displayed:  "The select light is off.  Please press the
'select' button, and click OK to continue."  Sure enough, pressing the select
button and then OK worked.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't get into the database."
</ul><p>
I check the usual stuff, but it's all fine.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Can you go and check if the server is working?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What do you mean, 'no'?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, I can't do that."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Why not?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, it's not there."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "It's WHAT?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "They took it away to be upgraded."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What seems to be the trouble?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, my monitor is going out.  Does that have anything
 to do with my hard drive?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
My best friend's family recently bought a new computer. They had all
the hardware set up and the software ready to be installed when the
stepdad picks up the Windows 95 box and says to his wife:<p>
<ul>
<li> "How do they get the box into the computer?"
</ul><p>
I cracked up in his face and haven't been welcome there since.  Apparently he
thought that to install software you had to get the box in there somehow.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I'm having a problem installing your software.  I've
 got a fairly old computer, and when I type 'INSTALL', all it says is
 'Bad command or file name'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, check the directory of the A: drive -- go to
 A:\ and type 'dir'."
</ul><p>
Customer reads off a list of file names, including 'INSTALL.EXE'.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "All right, the correct file is there.  Type 'INSTALL' again."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ok."  <em>(pause)</em>  "Still says 'Bad command or file name'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Hmmm.  The file's there in the correct place -- it
 can't help but do something.  Are you sure you're typing
 I-N-S-T-A-L-L and hitting the Enter key?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes, let me try it again."  <em>(pause)</em>  "Nope,
 still 'Bad command or file name'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  <em>(now really confused)</em>  "Are you sure you're
 typing I-N-S-T-A-L-L and hitting the key that says 'Enter'?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, yeah.  Although my 'N' key is stuck, so I'm
 using the 'M' key...does that matter?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I recently overheard this family conversation:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>My Mother-In-Law</b>:  "The computer you have works, right?"
<li><b>My Husband</b>:  "Yes, it's brand new, why?"
<li><b>My Mother-In-Law</b>:  "Well I was wondering if I could put mine like that."
<li><b>My Husband</b>: "What do you mean?"
<li><b>My Mother-In-Law</b>: "Well the big box, it's on the wrong side."
<li><b>My Husband</b>:  "What big box?"
<li><b>My Mother-In-Law</b>: <em>(pointing to the CPU case)</em> "That one."
<li><b>My Husband</b>: "I don't know what you mean."
<li><b>My Mother-In-Law</b>: "Well ours is on the right."
<li><b>My Husband</b>:  "It doesn't matter which side it's on, as long as the
 cable reaches."
<li><b>My Mother-In-Law</b>: "Really?"
<li><b>My Husband</b>: "Really."
<li><b>My Mother-In-Law</b>:  "So that means I can put the printer anywhere too?"
<li><b>My Husband</b>: <em>(chuckling)</em> "Yeah, Mom."
</ul>

A customer trying to get 16 million colors on a new Windows 95 system phones
for help.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Sir, are you familiar with computers?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Of course!  I am the main tech at ACER Africa!!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok.  Have you loaded the display drivers for Windows 95?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Where is it?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "It's on one of the black disks which you've
 received with your PC."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh!  I see it.  There's three of them.  On one is
 written OS/2, the other is Windows 3.11, and the last one has
 Windows 95 written on it.  Which one do I use?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
At our company we have asset numbers on the front of everything. They give
the location, name, and everything else just by scanning the computer's
asset barcode or using the number beneath the bars. <p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Hello.  I can't get on the network."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok. Just read me your asset number so we can open an outage."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What is that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "That little barcode on the front of your computer."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok. Big bar, little bar, big bar, big bar . . ."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "I need you to boot the computer."
<li><b>Customer:</b> <em>(THUMP! Pause.)</em> "No, that didn't help."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My program doesn't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What happens when you try to connect?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Nothing."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Nothing at all?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "It gives me an error message."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What does the error message say?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I don't know."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What is on your computer screen now?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "The computer is upstairs."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Do you have a phone in the same room as the computer?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, I can't have the computer on while I'm on the phone with you."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "That's fine, we just need to check your settings
 a bit.  Would you be able to plug a phone in upstairs and call us back?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't plug the phone in upstairs, the computer is
 plugged in upstairs."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, all you will have to do is unplug the
 computer from the phone jack, plug the phone in, and call us back."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "What do you mean?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "All you have to do is unplug the phone cord from
 the phone plug in the wall where the computer is plugged in and plug
 in the phone from downstairs into the wall."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I'm not a computer person, don't talk technical with me."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "All you have to do is unplug the phone that we
 are talking on from the wall, carry it upstairs, and plug it into the wall there."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I'm going to have to call you back.  I'm pretty confused."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Um, ok."

I'm the I.S. manager of a small manufacturing company.  Recently, I had
a user approach me to ask if she could open her own "things" on someone
else's computer.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, just log in as yourself."
<li><b>User</b>: "How do I do that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Just type the name you usually use where it says
 'Name', and your usual password."
<li><b>User</b>: "Oh, ok.  But how does the computer know it's me and not
 [the person who normally uses the machine]?"
</ul><p>
Two days later, I received a similar call from another employee.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, just log in as yourself."
<li><b>User</b>: "With my name, you mean?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, that's right."
<li><b>User</b>: "So how does the computer know that I'm using it and not
 [the person who normally uses the machine]?"
</ul><p>
Shaking my head somewhat, I settled down to do some network maintenance,
when lo and behold YET ANOTHER user rang.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>User</b>: "I need to access my files whilst I cover reception. Can I do that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes, if you get [receptionist] to log off and just
 log on as yourself."
<li><b>User</b>: "But won't I get [receptionist's] stuff?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, if you log on with your name, you'll get your own things."
<li><b>User</b>: "Oh, ok.  How does it know whose things to display?"
</ul><p>
This question and answer has now been submitted to the company
newsletter.
<p><hr><p>
My father works for a multinational company and he is the manager
of a project that implements a new sales support system in the
entire region he is operating in.  The program itself is a
distributed database, allowing individual users to make their own
updates on their laptop PCs and then uploading their changes to a
server as well as downloading all the changes the other users have
made.  When he wrote the instructions to the sales representatives
on how to do this he got the letter back from one of the regional
offices with complaints.  His original instructions read like this:<p>
<kbd>
From the File menu, select OS-Shell.  This will make your screen
look like this: <b>C:\SPS\WIN</b>
<p>
Now type <b>DOWNLOAD</b> to..., blah, blah, blah, etc, etc.
</kbd>
The hand-written remark on the sheet of paper was, "These
instructions are incorrect and cannot be followed!  Right after
C:\SPS\WIN, a strange bracket (&gt;) pops up and it <em>will not</em> go away!"
<p><hr><p>
One day a friend of mine called me up to tell me he was thinking of buying
a computer. This guy is particularly sensitive to criticism and not to exactly
in the upper eschelon of the IQ range, and personally I don't think he should
own a programmable VCR much less a computer, but he's a good guy, so I said
"good for you." The following conversation ensued:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Him</b>: "Well I have a couple questions though, that I thought I
 should ask you, cause you know about those things, right?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Yeah, ok, what do you want to know?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Well...what one should I buy?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "What do you want to do with it mostly? Play games, word
 processsing (blah blah blah)...?"
</ul><p>
Twenty minutes later....<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Him</b>: "Well, I think probably I should get a real fast one, you
 know, cause I want it to go fast so I don't have to wait for the Internet."
</ul><p>
I proceed to explain, SLOWLY, about the difference between megahertz and
modem speed, which takes another twenty minutes.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Him</b>: "So how much is this going to cost me anyway?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "It all depends on what you want. Some stuff costs more.
</ul><p>
(Now, let me say here that at the very begining of all this I had stated that neither a
monitor nor a printer would come with a computer itself, unless you went for
a package deal. He was, at this point saying that he wanted to spend about
$500 and that everything had to be from the same manufacturer. This was
when the 550 P3 had just come out, so prices were still higher than $500 for
any system you could go buy in a Circuit City, which he said he HAD to do.)<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Him</b>: "Well, you know, I just want the basic stuff, a monitor,
 and a printer and a scanner, and maybe a camera, plus the stuff to
 make cards and print photos and all that, and the stuff to take care
 of paying my bills, and online."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok, well, you need to get a system first, then think about
 the extras.  You really need to learn the basics first. A computer
 with a monitor and a printer is probably going to be a minimum of
 $800 to $1000, if you really want them all to be from the same company."
<li><b>Him</b>: "REALLY?! Well, ok, but I probably will need two printers,
 so it'll be more then, huh?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "What?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Yeah, you can do that, right, hook up two of the same
 printer to one computer?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Well...NO, you can't."
<li><b>Him</b>: "But I'll need to do that!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "No, really, you won't. Why do you think that?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Ok, wait, I know, what about two computers? Can you do that?
 Can you hook two computers together?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "But...why?  No."
<li><b>Him</b>: "But I am going to NEED that! You can't do that for me?!"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok, ya know what, what the hell are you talking about?!?
 No one ever NEEDS to do what you are talking about doing so why do
 you think you need to do this?!?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Well, when I go to print out that manuscript I'm going to
 write, it'll probably be like 800 pages or so, so how am I ever
 going to get one printer to print that much, and one computer probably
 can't even hold that much in one thing right?"
</ul><p>
Inside I was going ballistic at this point, and it did boil over,
especially since there is NO WAY there is 800 pages worth of anything in this
guy's head, but I explained that (a) one computer can in fact "hold" that much
and a whole lot more, and (b) one printer (unless it is a huge Xerox or other
office type industrial machine) CAN'T hold that much paper in one shot.
<p>
I hope that none of you nice tech support people never EVER get a
call from this guy, because I guarantee you it will be the worst call you
ever get in your life. You guys may all have to get together and dedicate a
page to him, posting only his calls, just to vent your anger. He is the
cupholder guy, the NOSMOKE.EXE guy, the guy who insists he "hasn't changed
anything" when he really edited his AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS to include
lines like "and don't say I'm bad and an invalid," and the guy who has
everything plugged in but nothing where it is supposed to be plugged in. He
WILL have his powerstrip plugged into itself and will insist that it is NOT.
May the force be with you all; you'll need it.
