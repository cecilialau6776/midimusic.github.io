Sometimes it's pathetic what people will try to pull and apparently think
they'll get away with.  Nice try.  Better luck next time.

I work for Iomega tech support. One day, when I was answering the AOL message
board questions, I ran across a letter complaining that this person's zip
drive had ejected a zip disk clear across the room and hit her dog in the eye.
The dog supposedly lost vision in that eye and wanted Iomega to pay for the
vet bill. I wrote back asking for a picture of the injury.  I got back a
picture of a dog wearing a pirate patch.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I got this problem. You people sent me this install
 disk, and now my A: drive won't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Your A drive won't work?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "That's what I said. You sent me a bad disk, it got
 stuck in my drive, now it won't work at all."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did it not install properly? What kind of error
 messages did you get?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I didn't get any error message. The disk got stuck in
 the drive and wouldn't come out. So I got these pliers and tried to
 get it out. That didn't work either."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You did what sir?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I got these pliers, and tried to get the disk out, but
 it wouldn't budge. I just ended up cracking the plastic stuff a bit."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I don't understand sir, did you push the eject button?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, so then I got a stick of butter and melted it
 and used a turkey baster and put the butter in the drive, around the
 disk, and that got it loose.  Then I used the pliers and it came out
 fine. I can't believe you would send me a disk that was broke and defective."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Let me get this clear. You put melted butter in
 your A: drive and used pliers to pull the disk out?"
</ul><p>
At this point, I put the call on the speaker phone and motioned at the other
techs to listen in.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Just so I am absolutely clear on this, can you
 repeat what you just said?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I said I put butter in my A: drive to get your crappy
 disk out, then I had to use pliers to pull it out."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did you push that little button that was sticking
 out when the disk was in the drive, you know, the thing called the
 disk eject button?"
</ul><p>
Silence.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, did you push the eject button?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, but you people are going to fix my computer, or I
 am going to sue you for breaking my computer?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Let me get this straight. You are going to sue our
 company because you put the disk in the A: drive, didn't follow the
 instructions we sent you, didn't actually seek professional advice,
 didn't consult your user's manual on how to use your computer
 properly, instead proceeding to pour butter into the drive and
 physically rip the disk out?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ummmm."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you really think you stand a chance, since we
 do record every call and have it on tape?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(now rather humbled)</em> "But you're supposed to help!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I am sorry sir, but there is nothing we can do for
 you.  Have a nice day."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A client brought in a computer with a hard drive problem.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "The computer crashed.  I had five years' worth of
 work on this computer, and you have to save my data."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, we don't have any data recovery services,
 but I can suggest a few local businesses that do."
</ul><p>
I gave him a list of several places he could go to get his data back.  He
left, but later he called back.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I called those places.  They're all too expensive,
 so you have to do it for me."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Hi, I recently bought a computer, and I seem to be
 having problems."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What type of problems?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Nothing seems to be working at all."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hmmm, what kind of computer is it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "<em>[brand]</em>."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Actually, we don't sell that brand of computer here."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I know, I bought it from a friend of mine."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "May I ask why you are calling us for support?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Aren't you a computer store?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I was in there yesterday."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "And you bought something from us?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, but you sell computers so you should fix them."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did we sell your computer to you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did we sell anything to you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Why should we be supporting something we didn't sell you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, who should I be calling?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Probably your friend, or the manufacturer of the computer."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "You are not very much help, you know."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I am sorry but there is not much I can do for you,
 unless you would like to bring the computer in and pay a fee for fixing it."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Why should I have to pay for you to work on my computer?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, I am hanging up now."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A client was having a problem where the software could not find the
correct directory.  I asked what directory he had typed.  Then I
directed him through Windows Explorer to make certain that the directory
existed.  It did.  At a loss to understand why this was happening, I
finally sent him a version of the software that created a log of its
actions.  I asked him to try it and mail the log file back to me.
Viewing the log, I noticed he had misspelled the directory name.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "The problem seems to be that you're
 misspelling the directory name.  When you type the directory name
 in, you have to be very careful to spell it correctly."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I was.  But after I pressed <em>Enter</em>, the
 software removed the letter 'i'."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Efforts to hide chauvanism can be so transparent.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Thank you for calling technical support.
 How may I help you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I'm sorry, miss -- I have a hearing problem and can't
 hear women's voices too well.  Would you transfer me to a man, please?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Welcome to [manufacturer] tech support. Can I
 get your customer number or serial please?"
<li><b>Operator</b>: "I'm the operator, and I have a lady on the line.
 She's got some really bad trouble, and she's crying and needs help."
</ul><p>
Um.  What kind of problem could this be if the operator is getting involved?<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Uh, ok."
</ul><p>
The operator puts the customer through.  She didn't sound the least bit
hysterical or sound like she'd been crying.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My husband called here yesterday becuase we had a
 problem with the hard drive. He was told to order a new hard drive, and
 now it doesn't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "The hard drive failed, and the new one is bad?
 Did you get the new hard drive from us?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, you don't understand. We haven't ordered a new
 hard drive yet.  The system's out of warranty by only a couple days,
 and I want you to replace it for free."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "I'll need to get your customer number. If it's
 only a few days, it's possible, but I'll still have to talk to my
 supervisor to get it approved."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't want you to talk to your supervisor. I want to
 talk to your supervisor. When I had my refrigerator repaired, it was
 out of warranty by three months, and I didn't have to pay a cent.
 I want my hard drive replaced."
</ul><p>
After lots of ranting, I finally got her serial number.  I discovered
that the system was four months out of warranty, not just a couple days.
Furthermore her system was trouble-free until yesterday. I told her that my
supervisor was on the phone and asked if I could have him call her back. She
reluctantly gave me her last name (only) and her phone number.
<p>
I approached my supervisor and told him the story. He loves bursting the
bubbles of this kind of customer.  He said he'd wait an hour and call her back.
<p>
I checked the customer notes forty-five minutes later, and she'd called back
complaining to customer service about me. It made its way up the food chain
until the director of customer service ended up promising to call her back.
<p>
Finally, my supervisor called her back, telling her exactly what I told her
(and what <em>all</em> the customer service reps told her). No out of warranty
pro bono replacement of her hard drive.  I overheard a piece of the
conversation he had with her:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>My Supervisor</b>:  "...No, ma'am, we do not sell microwave ovens or
 refrigerators. We sell computers, and the warranty has expired. You
 will not get a new hard drive for free."
</ul><p>
When I quit the company in July 1997, I checked back and discovered that the
director of customer service had never called her back.
<p><hr><p>
The only thing scarier than when someone tries to get away with something
obvious is when it works.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Will this card make Windows faster?"
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "Yes, well maybe, if not just bring it back,
 and we'll give you a full refund."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "But doesn't the store have a no-return policy on
 opened products?"
<li><b>Salesman</b>: "Well, yes."
</ul><p>
At this point the customer preceded to standup and walk to the counter
with the product under his arm.
<p><hr><p>
My old boss spent some time writing statistical analysis packages for
the Archimedes.  One of them got fairly popular for Archie software, and he
started a small business selling it.  For those who don't know, Archie
software usually came as source code and was executed through an interpreter.
<p>
One day at a scientific meeting, he noticed that another company was showing
Archie software with remarkably similar functionality to his own, so he
wandered over.  The longer he watched, the more familiar it looked.  Eventually,
when the sales representative had gathered a good crowd, he asked in a loud
voice:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>My Boss</b>: "Are you using my copyrighted code for this?"
<li><b>Sales Representative</b>: "Of course not."
<li><b>My Boss</b>: "So what happens if you press [key combination]?"
<li><b>Sales Representative</b>: "Nothing."
<li><b>My Boss</b>: "Do it for me."
<li><b>Sales Representative</b>: "Ok sir, but I can assure you it does--"
</ul><p>
The screen displayed my boss' copyright notice.  All they'd done
was remove the front end.
<p>
It widely accepted as the biggest laugh of the show.
