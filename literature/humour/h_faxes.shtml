<H3>2.11 Faxes</H3>
<blockquote><h4>
Faxes are often perceived as magical devices in the eyes of
the general public.  Most people understand that faxes use
phone lines, if not necessarily how, but others equate faxes
to black magic and mysticism.

One guy went to a bank to make a transaction. The clerk said that some data
should be sent by fax to the central bank. So he put the sheet into the fax
machine and pressed the send button. It appeared that the transfer was
performed successfully, but the clerk thought otherwise. So he sent the
sheet again. Frustrated, he gives up.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Him</b>: "We can't send it -- they have no paper."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "How can you tell?"
<li><b>Him</b>:  "See here, this little reading blinking 'no paper'?"
</ul>

At the Microsoft web site, when I tried to register for some freebies
without giving away too much about myself, I received the following error:<p>
<ul>
<li> "We need your fax number in order to respect your wishes not to receive
	unsolicited faxes."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A customer called to say he couldn't get his computer to fax anything.
After forty minutes, the tech discovered the man was trying to fax a
piece of paper by holding it in front of the monitor screen and hitting
the "send" key.

The Met office is now using fax machines to give local authorities early
warning of severe weather.  The Hampshire emergency planning office said,
"Rather than having to rely on telephones, for instance, where lines are
at risk in bad weather, we are encouraging the wider use of fax machines."

I work on the help desk for a certain credit card verification software
package.  The main problem that we have with it is getting modems to connect
at 1200 and 2400 baud.  Anyway, looking through the fax queue
the other day, I came across a two page fax addressed to one of the techs. The
cover page says, "Jim -- Here is the modem information you requested."
Figuring I'd help Jim out, I decide to take a look. It took me a minute to
figure it out, but I finally was able to determine what the large, mostly
black page was. The customer had pulled his internal modem out of his machine,
photocopied it, and sent it in. The worst part of this call though was Jim
trying to explain to the customer why this wasn't helpful and that it wasn't
really necessary to fax a copy of the other side.

One of our new hires recently walked around the print room, milling about,
looking somewhat puzzled.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Technical Trainer</b>:  "Can I help you with anything?"
<li><b>New Hire</b>:  "I'm waiting for a fax, but there's nothing coming through."
<li><b>Technical Trainer</b>:  "Carol probably switched it off when she
 left, as she doesn't want any confidential faxes coming through when
 she's not here."
<li><b>New Hire</b>:  "But the green light is on, and it says, 'Ready' on the display."
<li><b>Technical Trainer</b>:  "That's the printer."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Overheard at the office:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>First Person</b>:  "Do you know anything about this fax machine?"
<li><b>Second Person</b>:  "A little.  What's wrong?"
<li><b>First Person</b>:  "Well, I sent a fax, and the recipient called back
 to say all she received was a cover sheet and a blank page.  I tried
 it again, and the same thing happened."
<li><b>Second Person</b>:  "How did you load the sheet?"
<li><b>First Person</b>:  "It's a pretty sensitive memo, and I didn't want
 anyone else to read it by accident, so I folded it in half."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Once I needed to send a fax to someone.  I had the following conversation with
his secretary.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Please receive the fax message for Mr. <em>[name]</em>."
<li><b>Secretary</b>: "Ok!"
</ul><p>
Pause.
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "Could you start, please?"
<li><b>Secretary</b>: <em>(pause)</em> "What do you want me to do?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Start receiving the fax message."
<li><b>Secretary</b>: "Oh, I'm sorry, I'm fresher now. Please, tell me what to do."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Do you have a fax machine on this number?"
<li><b>Secretary</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Ok, just press the biggest green button on it."
<li><b>Secretary</b>: <em>(pause)</em> "I can't find it.  Just a moment I'll
 ask somebody to find it." <em>(long pause)</em> "Nobody in the office
 can find that button.  There are too many buttons here, but none are
 green. There are white and gray buttons with letters and digits on them."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Hmmm. What kind of fax do you have?"
<li><b>Secretary</b>: "Fax-modem."
</ul>

A tech asked a customer for a "screen shot."  He also requested she
fax him the result.  Lo and behold, through the fax came a photocopy
of a Polaroid picture of her screen.
<p><hr><p>
A customer once asked me if I could fax him a copy of a disk instead of sending
it through the mail.  If I didn't need my job I would have told him that I
would, but he'd have to wait a bit because Domino's was faxing me a pizza.
<p><hr><p>
I once received a fax with a note on the bottom to fax the document
back to the sender when I was finished with it, because he needed to keep it.
