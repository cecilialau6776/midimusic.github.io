<H3>3.2 Email Magic</H3>
<blockquote>
<h4>Email is one of the most popular applications of computer
networks.  It's yet another item that the general public
raves about but doesn't really understand.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "If I want somebody to send a reply to my email...should
 I include a self-addressed stamped envelope along with it?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Tech Support through email:
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I CAN'T READ OR RECEIVE EMAIL!  HELP!"
</ul>
We're only allowed to reply through email, so I almost deleted it.  But
I reconsidered.
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes you can."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
The following letter was received, through email, mind you, to a friend
of mine:
<p>
<kbd>
Apparently I have read-only access with the email, but my boss would like
me to be able to send messages as well.  Is there any way this can be
established with my account?
</kbd>
<p><hr><p>
When I started working here, I got myself all the computer
accounts I needed, including an email account.  I was given
my passwords for all systems except email.  After about a week, I
called up the appropriate person to find out what the problem was
and was told that my password had been emailed to me.
<p><hr><p>
A customer was inquiring about the features of a certain machine. Among
his questions was, "Does it come with an email?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I tried sending email to 1.404.123.4567 but the
 emailer wouldn't let me."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Um, that's a telephone number."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "How may I help you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I'm writing my first email."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, what seems to be the problem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well I can get the 'a'.  But how do I put the circle
 around it?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I send you all this email, but I never get a response
 from you? Why? I don't like your service. Answer me before I cancel!"
</ul><p>
There was no return address on the email, and the Reply-To: field was set
to 'mail'.
<p><hr><p>
I had a user say that the email messages she was trying to send would come
back undeliverable.  I went to her machine to take a look.  The two messages in
her out basket had valid email addresses in the To: line, but the text of her
message was stored in the Cc: and Bcc: lines.
<p>
This user had been using the same computer and the same email program for over
a year.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't get my email!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What's the exact problem you're having?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I called in earlier and I was told to go to Eudora to
 check for mail, but there's no Eudora channel."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Where are you looking for Eudora?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm in mIRC of course."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Doing phone support for a software company, we had a customer that
needed an update to our program.  We told her that we had placed it in
her mailbox, and it was there waiting on her to pick it up (our customers
had "mailboxes" on our dial up server). She told us it wasn't there, so
we asked her to check again just to be sure. She said ok, put the
phone down, and was gone for about five minutes. Finally she came back and
said, "It's still not there.  I knew it wouldn't because our postman
only comes around 11:00am."  She had walked outside and checked her
street mailbox.
<p><hr><p>
The company I work for recently sent out (completely voluntary) customer
information cards, asking for the customer's name, home address, and
email address.  On more than one card, the email address field was filled
in with the word "same" and an arrow pointing to the home address field.
<p><hr><p>
I have a user who still insists that he should not have to dial in to get
his remote e-mail.  The computer should just know to turn it on.  When he
asked if the other remote users in the company knew this, I said, "Well, I
have never had this question before."  He accused me of calling him
stupid and proceeded to call his manager to complain about our service.  His
manager laughed him off the phone and signed him up for training.
<p><hr><p>
I run a mailing list.  Like most others, it's set up so if you send email to
the list with "unsubscribe" in the message, you'll be unsubscribed from the
mailing list automatically.
<p>
I should tell you how many times I've seen "unsubscribe" spelled.  People get
so mad at me because "it doesn't work right" when they fail to realize that
they've misspelled "unsubscribe." This is a quote from one such person, who
wasn't even consistent:
<ul>
<li> "Hi.  I try unbuscribe but it not let me unsubbscibe.  Please unsubscibe me NOW!"
</ul><p>
<p><hr><p>
The following was received via email from a customer:<p>
<kbd>
Dear Help Desk:
<p>
Hmmm.  This appeared in my inbox as I was writing you about Outbox trouble.
So, apparently that email sat in my outbox BUT was also delivered... so I
just BET the computer thinks I was sending it from the LS Mailbox, whence
mail DOES sit in the outbox even if it was delivered.  That was a forwarding
of a message which had ORIGINALLY come into the LS mailbox BUT I had moved
it into MY inbox before forwarding.  I guess the computer remembered where
it had originally arrived, does that make sense?  This is this not a PAB
problem but a Shared Inbox thing, a feature not a bug?
</kbd>
<p><hr><p>
Cut directly from our support log:<p>
<kbd>
&gt; jim,  when  i  send e-mail!  do i use ink,  like if i was writing?  i<br>
&gt; had to put in new ink in<br>
&gt; my printer, so i  was  wondering  if  e-mail  use'es  ink.<br>
&gt;   thank you<br>
</kbd>
<p><hr><p>
A client brought his PC into the office.  "Eudora just doesn't work!" he
complains.  The tech opened Eudora.  Five minutes later it opened.  He had
about 200 letters minimized.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Whaddaya mean, 'I need to close them'?  Aren't they closed?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I've been away a few days and it seems my mail has
 built up to the point where I can't get it anymore."
</ul>
Small wonder.  It turned out, the user had 30,000 messages in his email box."
<p><hr><p>
This morning someone came barging into my office, panic stricken, and frantic.
"All my mail I saved in one of my folders is gone!!!" she said.  I asked her
which folder she had saved it to. "Deleted Items," she said.
<p><hr><p>
A few months ago we had panicked users stating that they couldn't get to
their mail and were getting error messages.  Lo and behold, the mail
directory had been moved to our server.  (We use a single database
oriented mail system.)  When we went into the console to find out where,
when, and who moved the mail directory, we found that it had been moved by a
user.  (Users need full read, write, and modify access to the mail folder
beause it is a shared database -- a setup like this is itself a computer
stupidity.)  When questioned why she did this, she replied, "The network
needed cleaning up."
<p><hr><p>
Someone here at work, who just couldn't grasp the big picture of computers
and computer networks, had something go wrong with his workstation and, for
the day, had to use a different one in another lab.  When he read new email
from the second workstation, he replied, "How did you know what machine to
send it to?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't get my email."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What software are you using?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What do you mean?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(sigh)</em> "What do you get your email on?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My computer."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes, I just got this disk in the mail. Does it give me email?
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes, ma'am, it does."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, can I have my answering machine hooked up so
 that I can just check my email from my answering machine?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, no, ma'am, it does not work that way."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Now, you listen, young man, there is no reason for you
 to get smart with me!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, ma'am, I understand.  I was just trying to
 explain to you how it works."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, young man, you have to understand in my day this
 stuff did not even exist."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "You're having a problem with getting your mail?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, tell me line by line everything you do."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I click 'check mail' and it asks me for my password."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, so you type your password."
<li><b>Customer:</b> "No, I already did when I logged on, so I click 'Cancel'."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, Ma'am, you have to type your password."
<li><b>Customer:</b> <em>[pause]</em> "Hey, what do you know, I got some mail!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I once had a customer call me up wanting to send something via email.  She
said no matter what she did it wouldn't go through.  After much debating over
the settings, I finally asked her what she was trying to send.  It turned out
she was trying to email a <em>box</em> to her daughter for her birthday.  I
still haven't quite figured out how she thought that would work.
<p><hr><p>
When I was setting up a service call with Apple computer, the girl
was getting my info.  She asked if I had another way of being
reached other than by the phone number I gave her.  I said that I
could be reached by email.  She asked for my address.  I gave it to
her.  Then she wanted the phone number for my email address.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>My Supervisor</b>:  "I have email now."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Great.  What's the address?"
<li><b>My Supervisor</b>:  "'dmusket506'."
<li><b>Me</b>:  <em>(writing it down)</em>  "Ok, what's the rest?"
<li><b>My Supervisor</b>:  "That's it."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't seem to send any email."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What are you doing to send it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I write it down on a piece of paper, slide it into
 the slot on the front of my computer, and click on 'send mail'."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't send an email. Is the Internet full?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
The other day I took exception to an insulting joke that someone had sent me,
repeatedly, in his email signature.
<p>
His response: "Don't draw conclusions about me from my email signature!"
<p>
Isn't that what an email signature is <em>for</em>?
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Uh, I'm trying to send email to my daughter and she's
 not receiving it."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, sir, what is her email address?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't know.  She doesn't even have a computer.
 Can't I send it to her post office?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Once my friend tried to send me a message by clicking on the "mailto:" link
on my web page -- but no one had set up email on her system, so it
didn't work.
<p>
She came to me the next day and told me about it.  "Your computer must not have
been turned on," she said, diagnosing the problem.
<p><hr><p>
I received two differently worded email letters that said essentially the
same thing (obviously something happened and the sender didn't realize the
first letter had gotten sent, so she typed up a second and sent that too).
The letters were complaining on the subject of foul language in the movies,
and she asked if anything could be done about it.  I maintain a movie-related
web site, so this did not seem out of the ordinary to me.  I answered her,
saying she should contact the studios directly.
<p>
The next thing I know, I received another letter from the address.  It asked
who I was and how in the world had I gotten hold of this movie language
letter.  It concluded by saying, "This is not my regular email address, so
please respond to this one...."
<p>
All I could figure out was that this person had logged into her friend's account,
found a letter of email addressed to her friend in response to her friend's
email, and got confused.
<p>
I answered her, saying who I was and that I didn't know how or where the
original email had come from.  I speculated on a couple theories, including
the one above (expressed in less demeaning terms), to help sort out the
problem.
<p>
She writes back acting all snotty, acting like I'm a nosy little jerk unduly
interested in her Internet access, and then, in that "I asked you once" tone,
would I please tell her honestly how I came about that original letter on
the subject of movie language?  She went on to say that she really did write
the letter, but it wasn't supposed to be sent to me.  It was supposed to go
to the Vice President of the United States at whitehouse.gov.  My email
address is absolutely nothing like that of our Vice President's.  To type mine
out accidentally when trying to type out his, you need to mistype somewhere
around 25 characters in just the right way.  To this day, I have no idea how
she flubbed this up, and I know she doesn't.
<p>
I wrote her back, telling her I didn't appreciate her attitude, and, for the
second time, that her original email was emailed normally to my mailbox and
that that that's how I came about it.
<p>
Three days later, I get yet another letter from her.  It was slightly
differently worded, but what it said was that I was acting like a nosy
little jerk unduly interested in her Internet access and then, in that
"I asked you once" tone, would I please tell her honestly how I came about
that original letter on the subject of movie language?
<p>
That's right, she sent me a differently worded version of the same email as
before.  I wrote back, hopefully for the last time, saying she should learn
how to read and write email before she chews someone out over it.  But with
her track record, I have no idea if she'll ever actually read it.
<p><hr><p>
This story is an example of a kind of mass stupidity mob that happens in
various forums on the Internet all the time.  I don't understand why.
<p>
I belong to a mailing list, the topic of which will remain unnamed.  The
list's only purpose is to send out a brief newsletter every day talking about
things of interest to the subscribers.  Consequently, the list is set up so
that, normally, only the owner of the list is allowed to send messages; none
of the recipients can post to it.  After months of running smoothly, the
mailing list software went haywire, and suddenly <em>everyone</em> was able
to post to the list.  Chaos broke out, and people started to send notes to
the list (a list of about 500 people, mind you) just to be "cute."  Had it
been left alone, the flood of mail would have quickly subsided.  But then a
wave of people started posting to the list telling these people to stop it.
Letters poured in reading "STOP IT!" and "DON'T REPLY!" and "Why are you
sending this to me?"  This triggered <em>more</em> people to do that, which
triggered <em>more</em>, and so on.  In the first couple hours, there were
easily seventy of these silly nonsense notes telling everyone else to stop
sending out mail.  You'd think common sense would keep people from "solving"
the problem by contributing to it.
<p><hr><p>
I subscribe to a listserver that covers an automotive topic.  Last year
one of the list members went on vacation and set up his email server
to autoreply to any email with a message that he was out of town.
Unfortunately, he didn't unsubscribe from the list before he left.
<p>
You can guess the result.  Everytime anyone sent a message to the list, this
guy's automated reply went out on it too.  The listserver fell down and went
"splat" a couple of times before things got sorted out.
<p><hr><p>
This story points out the amazing fact that, although it is great fun to
laugh at the mistakes of computer newbies, it takes the knowledge and
expertise of a fairly competent newbie system administrator to make
your sides really split.  That's me, and I maintain our organization's
UNIX systems.
<p>
There I was, looking at my screen, pondering what I saw.  It was a message,
stuck in the mail queue for no apparent reason.  So, I figured, "What the
hey, let's process the queue and see if it goes out."  It didn't.  And it
said it was stuck because it couldn't contact the remote site.  "They must
be down, then," I figured.  So, since I was bored, I decided to speed up
the rate at which the queue got processed by typing "sendmail -q5".  And
after about ten minutes, I got bored of watching the message sit there in
the queue and went on to other things.  I assume the message eventually
went, but I never went back to check up on it.
<p>
Later that day, someone sent out email to the whole office using a mailing
list that we had set up specifically for that purpose.  I got four copies
of the message.  Some people only got one; others got as many as seven or
eight.  Needless to say, I was a little shocked.  The sender insisted he
only hit 'send' once.  I dubbed around a little bit, looking for the cause,
but didn't find it.  So I left it until the next day.
<p>
The next day, people were complaining to me left and right that everytime they
used the mailing list to send office mail, people would get multiple copies.
I thought, "This is a serious problem now."  So I did what every good
newbie system administrator would have done in that situation.
I rebooted the mail server.  And lo and behold, it actually worked.
<p>
Feeling pretty good about myself, I went to check on the sendmail
daemon to see if it was running (as a sanity check more than anything --
mail was going out, so I knew it was running).  But I discovered, much to
my surprise, that sendmail wasn't running at all -- and mail was still
going out.
<p>
I was shocked.  I felt a little scared.  And then, suddenly, I felt
incredibly stupid.  I finally remembered that we don't USE sendmail, we
use SMTP.  So I checked the SMTP process, and there it was, happily processing
email.
<p>
It took me a few minutes to figure out what probably happened.  When I was
looking at the stuck job, I started a copy of the sendmail daemon.  Not only
that, I set it to a delay of only five seconds.  The regular daemon, SMTP,
is set by default to 30 or 60 seconds.
<p>
So when the queue got plugged by the mounds of mail going out in an
all-office mailing, was this:  SMTP got to it first, because the process was
triggered by the mail entering the queue.  But it wasn't fast enough to keep
ahead of sendmail.  Sendmail could process the queue but couldn't delete the
message from it after it had sent the message.  So while SMTP was plodding
through the messages one by one, sending them and cleaning them up, sendmail
was blazing through them, delete nothing, and do it all over again in another
five seconds.
<p>
As it happened, people who were at the physical bottom of the mailing
list got the most copies of the message, while the person at the top would
only get one or two.
<p>
Needless to say, I kept this knowledge to myself, and instead
of being the laughing stock of the office, I was the hero for having
"solved" the great mail problem.
