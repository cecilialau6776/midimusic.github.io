<H3>2.4 Keyboards</H3>
<blockquote>
<h4>
The quintessential input device, the keyboard, despite its
similarities to the typewriter, is nevertheless the subject
of great confusion.  Some of the most important, basic keys
are misunderstood.  Some even fail to recognize that hitting
a letter on the keyboard causes the same letter to appear on
the screen.

We have a service contract at a local college.  I got a call one day from
someone who said that their Mac IIsi was having a problem.  Upon
questioning him, he said that whenever he typed on the keyboard, the image
on the monitor was shaking.  All sorts of monitor problems ran through my
mind.  I asked him if it was only when he typed and he replied yes.  Well,
since it was a contract, I figured we'd better go see what was happening.  My
tech called me about ten minutes after arriving and reported that the
problem was not the computer, but his <em>desk</em>.  The desk vibrated every
time he typed on his keyboard.  I am still shaking my head on this one.  The
sad thing is that this guy has "Dr." in front of his name and is a professor
at a major college.
<p><hr><p>
For a computer programming class, I sat directly across from someone, and our
computers were facing away from each other.  A few minutes into the class, she
got up to leave the room.  I reached between our computers and switched the
inputs for the keyboards.  She came back and started typing and immediately
got a distressed look on her face.  She called the teacher over and
explained that no matter what she typed, nothing would happen.  The teacher
tried everything.  By this time I was hiding behind my monitor and quaking
red-faced.  I started to type, "Leave me alone!"
<p>
They both jumped back, silenced.  "What the..." the teacher said.  I typed,
"I said leave me alone!"  The kid got real upset.  "I didn't do anything to
it, I swear!"  It was all I could do to keep from laughing out loud.  The
conversation between them and HAL 2000 went on for an amazing five minutes.
<ul>
<li><b>Me:</b>  "Don't touch me!"
<li><b>Her:</b>  "I'm sorry, I didn't <em>mean</em> to hit your keys that
 hard."
<li><b>Me:</b>  "Who do you think you are anyway?!"
</ul>
Etc.  Finally, I couldn't contain myself any longer and fell out of my chair
laughing.  After they had realized what I had done, they both turned beet red.
Funny, I never got more than a C- in that class.
<p><hr><p>
Many people have called to ask where the "any" key is on their keyboards
when the "Press Any Key" message is displayed.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "If there is anything else we can help with, please
 give us a call."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well...I was wondering if you could just tell me
 something people ask you that is really stupid, so I don't feel like
 such a moron."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ma'am, you're not stupid.  People aren't born
 with knowledge, it takes time.  One of the silliest questions we get
 from new users is, 'Where is the <em>any</em> key?'"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, DUH!  Even I know where that is!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I have a friend who just bought a computer and was instructed to load a
program by typing "A:" and then the name of the program.
<p>
My friend told me it would not work because his keyboard was no good.  He said
he couldn't type the "dot over dot thingie" and that every time he tried to
type the "dot over dot thingie" he kept getting the "dot over comma thingie"
no matter how careful he was to press only on the very top of the key.<p>
When I taught him about the shift key, he thought I was a genius.
<p><hr><p>
One user told me he couldn't find the 'OK' button on his keyboard.
<p><hr><p>
I had a call from a customer who was complaining that when she typed, the
wrong letters came up on the screen.  After some investigation, I learned she
had pried off all the letter key caps off her keyboard and rearranged them
in alphabetical order.  You'd think she'd have figured out the problem herself
when her computer stopped working afterward.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Is the capslock light on?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I'm not a computer person."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
This, while fixing a problem starting up the system:
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What other strange irregularities do you notice when
 you boot up?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "My numlock lights up.  Could that be the problem?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I received a call from one of the top managers in our company.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Him</b>: "When I start up my computer and have to type in my
 program, I can use the numbers on the right side of the keyboard.  So
 that is great.  But sometimes, if I hit numlock, they don't work
 anymore, and I have to use the ones above the letters.  They work
 again if I hit numlock and a light goes on. Is this right?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "Yes.  Numlock is the number lock key.  It lets you switch
 between--"
<li><b>Him</b>: "So it's not broken?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "No."
<li><b>Him</b>: "Well I think you should tell others about this feature.
 I think they could use it."
<li><b>Me</b>: "That's a great idea."
<li><b>Him</b>: "Great then.  Bye."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Bye."
</ul><p>
I turned to my co-workers and said, "You won't believe the call I just
got..."
<p><hr><p>
One user noted that MAC keyboards are typically relatively
small, but that IBM keyboards are "big" things with "keys
all around the top and down the sides" and so forth.  He
figured that this might be one of the reasons why IBMs
and MACs "don't like to talk to each other."
<p><hr><p>
I was helping an executive-type over the phone with a VMS command.  I kept
giving him a command to type, something like "whois xyz1234".  He kept getting
an error back.  Finally I asked him to read exactly what he was typing,
letter-by-letter, "w-h-o-i-s-s-p-a-c-e-x-y-z-1-2-3-4".  I told him to type a
blank instead of the word "space."  He then asked me how to do that.  Trying
not to laugh, I explained what that long key at the bottom of the keyboard was
for.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Now press the spacebar."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Return bar?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, space bar.  Space."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I have an enter bar, return bar, and a shift key?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, space.  Space bar.  The long horizontal key."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  <em>[confused sounds]</em>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok, see your c, v, b, n, and m keys?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes...."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Right under them."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Use the right arrow key to move to the next
 field on the screen."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "You mean the 'Backspace' key?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, ma'am, the right arrow key."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "You mean the 'Enter' key?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, ma'am, the right arrow key."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I don't have a right arrow key."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(head in hands)</em> "Point to the space
 bar on the keyboard."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Now, move you finger to the right."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did you find the left arrow key?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "The right arrow key is two more keys to the right."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, ok."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "How many keys are on the 124-key keyboard?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Do I hit 'F' and '8' at the same time?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "What's the zero-with-the-slash-through-it mean?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Is that the letter zero or the number zero?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "How do you type an uppercase zero?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Your password will be...a small 'a' as in apple, a
 capital 'V' as in Victor, the number '7' --"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Is that a capital '7'?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Now, does it matter if that's an upper or lower case
 'forward slash'?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir, would you be so kind as to tell me what an
 upper case 'forward slash' looks like?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh, well, I guess that would make it a question mark!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok sir, just make it a lower case 'forward slash' then."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Do you want a forward backslash?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I teach an introductory programming course.  The first assignment is
to write a program to evaluate an integral.  A common question I get
is, "Where's the integral key?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You need to pick a password. It should contain a
 combination of numbers, symbols, and upper and lowercase letters."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Upper and lowercase? I don't understand."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You know, big letters and little letters?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, of course! But I have to say, you have to avoid
 that technical language with me!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I once watched our new system administrator trying to bring one of our
servers up.  He needed to type "i386" which was part of a path name.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Him</b>:  "Where's the key for that line thing?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Huh?"
<li><b>Him</b>:  "You know, that one that looks like an upside down
 exclamation mark."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "You mean the letter 'i'?"
<li><b>Him</b>:  "Yeah, that's it!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
This guy calls in to complain that he gets an "Access Denied" message every
time he logs in.  It turned out he was typing his username and password in
capital letters.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, let's try once more, but use <em>lower
 case</em> letters."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Uh, I only have capital letters on my keyboard."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Where can I find the letters 'com' and 'dot' on my keyboard?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "So I hold down control, alternator, and delete?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Back in the good old pre-PC days we sold a system that required
the user to hit Ctrl-A in order to sign on.  We sold one to some
outfit in Canada.  Well, trying to get them going over the phone
took an hour.  We'd say, "Hit Ctrl-A," and they'd say,
"Ok, we hit Ctrl, eh?  And nothing happened, eh?"
<p><hr><p>
I saw a woman sitting patiently at her desk, staring directly at her
monitor, doing nothing.  Figuring something was up, I looked over
her shoulder to see that she had typed her name on the command line.
I asked what she was waiting for, and her reply was that she was
waiting for the computer to log her on.  Only problem, she hadn't
hit the "LOG ON" key.  She'd have sat there all day.
<p><hr><p>
Another user called in one day with an installation problem.  I talked him
through the process of getting to a DOS prompt and asked him to type,
"D I R Space A Colon" and press Enter.  I heard 5 slow erratic key clicks
followed by a very long pause.  Finally, he asked, "What's the colon look
like?"  I told him it's the key with one dot below another dot.  "Oh!" he
exclaimed, "The two-dots key!  Why didn't you say so?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Exclamation mark -- that's the big stick with the dot
 underneath, right?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I had a customer the other day that called the "plus" sign a "prostitute" sign.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It still doesn't work."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "And you are typing the underscore character?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes. I call it the dash."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine had just discovered email, and I noticed him pause for a
few moments, examining the keyboard.  "What's wrong?" I asked.  He
said, "Where's the smiley key!?!"
<p><hr><p>
I worked at the computer help desk at Dartmouth College last year.  Once, one
of my co-workers finished a call, then looked at me blankly, then started
laughing.  The caller had spilled soda on her keyboard and removed
the bottom row of keys on her keyboard to get the liquid out.  She called
us so we could tell her the order of that row of keys.
<p><hr><p>
A user called me with problems installing her PC Access and it sounded like
it might be a defective floppy, so I had her get to a DOS prompt.  I told her
to type "D I R Space A Colon" and press Enter.  After a long pause she asked,
"Do you want anything in that space?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Type 'D I R Space A Colon.'"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Is there a space after 'space'?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I work in Front Line Support, and usually we dial into our customers
sites to troubleshoot problems. One evening a co-worker was not able to
dial into a customer's site, so he was working with the customer by
phone and trying to walk him through displaying system messages. The user
was in the computer room where there were multiple servers.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No matter what I type nothing is showing up on the screen."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Can you check to see that the keyboard is plugged in?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "No?  How come?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can't get behind the computers."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Pick up your keyboard, hold onto it, and take
 ten steps backward."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Ok."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Did the keyboard come with you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "That keyboard is not plugged into any of the
 systems. Is there another keyboard?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, there is one on a lower shelf. Oh. This one works."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I started hearing a very faint beep when I was typing, but it was not
consistent, and since it was so faint, it was hard to tell where it was
coming from. I pondered, confirmed that it wasn't any of the obvious problems,
and then started thinking that maybe my keyboard was messed up. I knew
better, but maybe there was a small alarm inside my keyboard...an "excess
wear" indicator, maybe? (I know, but I didn't have any better ideas.)
Finally I decided to sit down and figure it out once and for all.  I took the
keyboard off the desk to begin my detective work and found, underneath the
keyboard, a digital thermometer.  It had been sitting under there the whole
time.  My typing was hitting the on/off button on the thermometer, causing it
to beep.
<p><hr><p>
I find it curious how you almost never see "press any key" instructions that
are honest enough to say, "except Shift, Caps Lock, Control, Alt, Num
Lock, Scroll Lock...."
<p><hr><p>
It's really bad when the computer does something stupid.  Presumably, the
programmers of the operating system or system software would know better.
Many computers are known to report the following error message when the
keyboard is not plugged in:
<blockquote>
	"Error #101: No keyboard.  Press F1 to continue."
</blockquote>
...or some variation thereof.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "What am I getting a keyboard error for?  The keyboard
 isn't even plugged in!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Email from a friend:
<blockquote>
	"CanYouFixTheSpaceBarOnMyKeyboard?"
</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
I work on the help desk of a small ISP.  Yesterday I had a phone call from a
customer wanting to know how to set up his mail.  The mail server address
contained a hyphen.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, now insert a hyphen."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What's a hyphen?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "It's the same as a dash."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What's a dash?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Another name for a minus sign."
</ul><p>
He seemed to know what that was, so we proceeded to enter the rest of his
settings.  On completion, he got an error message saying he could not be
logged in to the mail server.  I took him back into the settings and
asked him to read out what he had entered for the mail server name.
When we got to the point where the hyphen should be, he said "squiggly line."<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hang on a second, what did you say?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Squiggly line."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, you need to put in a dash, or minus sign.
 It's just a horizontal line."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh."
</ul><p>
He tried again and still couldn't connect.  Back into the settings we go.
When he got to the point the hyphen should be, he said it was a
"horseshoe-like thingy."  We tried again.  Next time it was a "diagonal line."
I don't remember how many times we went through this.  Finally I had to direct
him to where the hyphen key was physically located on the keyboard.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Oh, is <em>that</em> what you mean?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
My father was just getting into using a computer.  He loved
Solitaire and would play with it for hours, so I thought I'd set him up
with a different game.  I set up Nascar Racing, and off he was,
having a great time, until the race ended.  I heard him
pressing keys and getting a bit frustrated.  Finally he asked me
for help.  He said that the game was broken.  It turned out that
the game was instructing him to "Press ESC," and he was hitting
the 'E', 'S', and 'C' keys in succession.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Ok Bob, let's press the control and escape keys at
 the same time.  That brings up a task list in the middle of the
 screen.  Now type the letter 'P' to bring up the Program Manager."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't have a 'P'."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "On your keyboard, Bob."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "What do you mean?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "'P' on your keyboard, Bob."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I'm not going to do that!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
My friend was on duty in the main lab on a quiet afternoon.  He noticed a
young woman sitting in front of one of the workstations with her arms crossed
across her chest and staring at the screen.  After about 15 minutes he noticed
that she was still in the same position only now she was impatiently tapping
her foot.  He asked if she needed help and she replied, "It's about time!
I pushed the F1 button over twenty minutes ago!"
