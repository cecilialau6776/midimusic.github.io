<H3>2.5 Floppy Abuse</H3>
<blockquote>
<h4>
Floppy disks routinely undergo severe ordeals by owners who
do not know how to treat them or even understand what they are.
One would think, in a world where audio cassettes and music CDs are
mainstream, people would understand that floppy disks are a similar medium.

<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Excuse me can I use this disk? It has a hole in it."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A customer saw me handling some floppies, and remarked, "How do they
get the words small enough to fit on there?"
<p><hr><p>
A company at which I once worked replaced their existing clones
and XTs with PS/2s.  Users were informed to convert their data
to 3 1/2 inch diskettes.  One user didn't replace everything.  Not
to worry, as she just folded the 5 1/4 inch floppy in half and
jammed it into the 3 1/2 inch drive.
<p><hr><p>
When one of the computer labs upgraded from Apple IIe computers to
Macs, one student came to me because she was having problems with
the new computers.  She had "reformatted" her 5 1/2" disks by
trimming them down with a pair of scissors so that they would fit
into the 3 1/2" drives.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I just got a copy of the new software you sent us, and 
 I'm having some problems."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What seems to be the problem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "The disk is stuck."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "You mean when you lift the latch, the disk won't
 pop out?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Exactly."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "By any chance was there already a disk in the
 drive when you put this one in?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No!  I'm not dumb."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Can you pull the disk out?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, the disk is too far back to be reached."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What do you mean, too far back?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "The disk is smaller than the regular disks that I
 normally use.  It's just too far back."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What size is this disk?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "About three inches, give or take."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "So, you placed a 3 1/2" disk in a 5 1/4"
 disk drive?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yeah, and now it's stuck.  How do I get it out?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>My Dad</b>:  "Hello.  I've got a problem with the computer."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "What's up?"
<li><b>My Dad</b>:  "Well, I did my document, and it looks fine on the
 screen.  I printed it too.  And I saved it."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Great!  You're getting the hang of the thing."
<li><b>My Dad</b>:  "Yes, I am.  I have just one problem."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Ok, what is it?"
<li><b>My Dad</b>:  "Well, I saved the file...."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Yes?"
<li><b>My Dad</b>:  "How do I rewind the disk?"
</ul><p>
That one warms my heart every time I think of it.
<p><hr><p>
When I was in third grade or so, we learned some computer skills on
an Apple ][e. One day, the software we were using wouldn't load on the
computer (keep in mind this is a classroom full of 9 and 10 year olds), and
the teacher said, "Oh, the window must be dirty," and proceeded to rub
the window of the 5 1/4" diskette with her thumb and forefinger, smearing
it badly. The entire class yelled at her to stop, but not before three or
four brisk rubs. Apparently she thought the disk was a little dusty that
morning, so she wiped it that way before the class got there, then again
when it wouldn't load for the class.
<p><hr><p>
When I was in seventh grade our principal substituted for our computer teacher.
One morning we walked into class and to our horror she had all of our disks
soaking in a big bin of soapy water.  Earlier that morning she had been
grading our assignments when she got an error message.  She assumed that the
disks were dirty, so she decided to clean them.  When we explained to her
that you can't get a disk wet, she said, "I didn't know that.  Next time I'll
just use a little Windex."
<p><hr><p>
It's not uncommon for new computer users to try to put disks in the wrong
drives -- ZIP disks in the floppy drive, floppies in the CD drive, etc -- but
once I saw a student mix up three.  He had put a 5 1/4" floppy in the CD
drive, then tried to access it via the A: drive, which was the 3 1/2" drive.
<p><hr><p>
Tech Support kept getting calls from this one client because any
disk which was sent to the client became unreadable after one day
in the field.  A live technician was sent out.  He asked what happened
after the client received the disk.  "I keep them right here, on the
side of the file cabinet," he said.  (Under a magnet!)
<p><hr><p>
The computer was having problems reading the disk.  I checked the
disk and found that it had a coffee ring on it.  I asked who set
their coffee cup on it, and one guy raised his hand.  I asked why,
and he said, "Well, I didn't want to hurt the table."
<p><hr><p>
One user, a gentleman quite unfamiliar with computers and very short on common
sense, had a floppy disk that wouldn't stay in the disk drive. He called the
help desk because his computer wasn't working as it normally did and wondered
if someone could take a look at it.<p>
The problem was his "solution" to his floppy disk problem.  To get it to stay
in, he used superglue to keep it in the drive.
<p><hr><p>
A customer was having diskette problems.  After trouble shooting for a while
(magnets, heat, etc), tech asked the customer what else was being done with
the diskette.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I put a label on the diskette, rolled it into the typewriter..."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Should that be a 3 1/2 inch or 5 1/4 inch disk?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Uhhh...how are they different?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Student</b>:  "Why isn't my computer saving to my floppy?"
<li><b>Teacher</b>:  "Is it in the drive?"
<li><b>Student</b>:  "No. Does it need to be?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A customer complied with a tech's request to send in a copy of a
defective diskette.  A few days later, the tech received a letter
from the customer along with a Xerox copy of the floppy.
<p><hr><p>
My professor logged into the computer in our classroom to show us a
spreadsheet she had set up on a floppy disk.  She double clicked on the
A: drive to get a directory listing, and she frowned and said, "These are
not the right files."<p>
So she closed the Explorer window, took the disk out, and logged off.  Then
she logged back in, put the disk back in, and double clicked on the A: drive
again.  She was astonished that the files still weren't the right ones.<p>
We never did find out what happened to the disk she'd originally put the
files on.
<p><hr><p>
A floppy-based computer would not boot.  I went to the site and
discovered that the 5 1/4" floppy was inserted sideways.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Here's your problem.  It's in wrong."
 <em>(started to put it in correctly)</em>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No!  It doesn't go in that way!  You'll <em>ruin</em>
 it!" <em>(the computer booted correctly)</em>
 "Well it never worked that way <em>before</em>."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Over the summer a couple years back, I was working for a small
chemical company as a process engineer.  The secretary in the area
where I worked had recently acquired a new Macintosh computer and
since I was one of the few who knew how to use it, I got called
when ever there was trouble.  Well, one time I got called to come
over and help her.  I got there and found out that she was having
problems getting the 3 1/2" disk into the disk drive.  It would only
go about half way in and no further.  I proceeded to check to see
if there was already another disk in the drive and also used a
paper clip to see if somehow the drive had gotten into the down
position.  I was stumped...until I looked down at the disk and
realized that she had put the disk label entirely on the front of
the disk instead of folding it around to the back like you're supposed
to.  In the process, she had literally taped the metal door shut so
it wouldn't open when she tried to put the disk in.  Apparently she
had labeled a whole pack of disks that way.
<p><hr><p>
One user kept her diskettes in a three ring binder -- but punched the holes in
the disk rather than the sleeve.
<p><hr><p>
One student turned in his program with the printout neatly stapled to the disk.
<p><hr><p>
One tech support person told a lady to insert a clean disk into the
drive.  She washed it first.
<p><hr><p>
A very common misconception is that the plastic case of a 5 1/4" disk
needs to be removed (with an x-acto knife or something) before the disk
can be used.
<p><hr><p>
A consultant showed a new user how to copy a disk to do backups
and told her to buy a box of disks.  She did, and when she got the
new box, she unwrapped the disks and did the backup.  The
consultant returned a week later, and the client proudly showed
him her backup disks.  To his amazement, she had 'peeled' off the
wrapping on all ten disks, including the metal shutter.  Her
explanation:  "I thought you had to expose the disk."
<p><hr><p>
One new user, diligently following instructions that you had to format new
floppy disks before using them, promptly went home and formatted all of his
program disks.  They were new, after all, and he wanted to use them.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "You've got to fix my computer.  I urgently need to
 print a document, but the computer won't boot properly."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What does it say?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Something about an error and non-system disk."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Look at your machine.  Is there a floppy inside?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, but there's a sticker saying there's an Intel inside."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
"How do I open this new-fangled floppy drive?" a user asked.  He was on an
IBM PC-XT, pointing to the hard drive.
<p><hr><p>
A student reported that he was trying to copy his assignment to 
floppy disk, but the machine he was using wasn't formatting the 
floppy correctly.  I asked him to try formatting it again so I could
watch.<p>
He correctly inserted the floppy, started the format correctly, 
but when it got 34% finished, he ejected it.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>: "What'd you do that for?"
<li><b>Him</b>: "Well, the file I want to store on there is very small,
 so I don't have to format the whole disk.  Is 34% enough?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
An unfailingly polite lady called to ask for help with a Windows installation
that had gone terribly wrong.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I brought my Windows disks from work to install them
 on my home computer."
</ul><p>
Training stresses that we are "not the Software Police," so I let the little
act of piracy slide.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Umm-hmm.  What happened?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "As I put each disk in it turns out they weren't initialized."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you remember the message exactly, ma'am?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(proudly)</em> "I wrote it down. 'This is
 not a Macintosh disk. Would you like to initialize it?'"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Er, what happened next?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "After they were initialized all the disks appeared
 to be blank.  And now I brought them back to work, and I can't read
 them in the A: drive; the PC wants to format them. And this is our
 only set of Windows disks for the whole office.  Did I do something wrong?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I work as a computer consultant at a school.  One day a very irritated -- and
irritating -- student walked in with a floppy disk.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't read my thesis off this disk, and I need it now.
 Also, why don't any of the computers on campus have <em>(some word
 processing program that is hopelessly outdated)</em> on them?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, we'll take a look at the disk and see if we
 can read it here.  As for <em>(the program)</em> it's not really
 being used anymore because better ones are available."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I bought my computer from the school four years
 ago, and it came with this program.  I'm going to file a complaint."
</ul><p>
She handed me the disk.  It was a really cheap brand -- I forget which -- and
the case was slightly cracked and missing the protective metal cover.  The
disk media itself had fingerprints on it and a sizable bend at one point.
I tried the disk out, and sure enough, no files were found.  I tried to
explain to her that this was a lost cause, but to no avail.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I've been using this disk since I came to
 this school, and it's always worked fine.  Your lab machines must
 have done something to it.  I want to speak to your manager."
</ul><p>
The sad thing is, since then, I've seen several other students with disks in
similar condition, and they all contained their only copies of their senior
theses.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Can I use this disk here in the lab?  It's blue."
</ul><p>
I said that she could, but I wanted to say, "Yes, we are an equal opportunity
computer lab."
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine purchased "colored" floppy disks so she could save email
attachments to disks.  The attachments were color GIF files, and all she
had around the house were black floppies.
<p><hr><p>
I was demonstrating MS Powerpoint to some students.  I imported some color
clip art into the program.  After I asked for questions, one girl asked if
I saved the file to color or black and white floppies.
<p><hr><p>
A few years ago, a woman called to complain that she bought a computer,
and after only a couple months, Windows didn't run anymore. She
further explained that her son had installed a game on the computer
and that that was the only thing the computer would run.
<p>
I went to her home and found that the son had created a boot diskette
for the game and never popped it out of the drive.
<p><hr><p>
Someone came up to me in such a big distress because we don't have
WordPerfect on our machines anymore. So I told this guy to use Microsoft Word
because it's the same sort of thing. Well, the guy told me that he needed to
save the resume he'll be typing, and since his disk had been used
previously with WordPerfect it therefore couldn't be used for Microsoft Word.
He formatted the disk for Wordperfect, he kept insisting, so it wouldn't
work for Microsoft Word.  Obviously I couldn't slap him on the face, but I
wanted to.
<p><hr><p>
I received a call from a secretary asking for a document to be converted
from WordPerfect 5.1 to WordPerfect 6.1.  So I did as she asked and emailed
the converted file back.  Later she called and asked, "If I copy this to a
disk, will it stay in 6.1 or will it go back to 5.1?"
<p><hr><p>
One user had a word processor that took 3 1/2" disks and
stored files on them using an MSDOS file system format.
He wanted to convert the files that were on his word processor
disks to his new MAC machine.  Unable simply to insert the
word processor disks into the MAC's disk drive and have them
be readable, he enlisted the aid of an acquaintance who had
a PC with MSDOS.
<ul>
<li><b>User:</b>  "Can you copy these files for me?"
<li><b>Acquaintance:</b>  "Sure.  Where do you want me to copy them, though?"
<li><b>User:</b>  "Onto a disk."
</ul>
He didn't grasp that a second disk, also formatted for PC use,
wouldn't work in his MAC any better than his originals.
<P>
Later on, he got an idea when he was reading the documentation
for a Disk Doctor program he had on his MAC.  The utility, he
discovered, could restore files that had been erased from a disk by
accidental deletion or reformatting.  So he took one of his
MSDOS-formatted word processor disks, reformatted it in his MAC,
then tried to get the Disk Doctor to recover the lost MSDOS files.
Didn't work, surprise, surprise.
<p><hr><p>
I was on duty one night at my university's computing centre.  A woman came
in with a disk that she wanted to retrieve some files from.  The disk was
in really bad shape; the metal door was missing, a boot print was on
it, and the label had been treated with white-out several times.  I
suggested she go buy another disk at the vending machine down the hall
while I tried to read the data off her disk.<p>
When she returned, I told her that I was able to get most of the
information off the old disk.  I asked for the new disk so I
could save the information.<p>
"Ok," she said, and started to hand the disk to me.  Then she paused and
said, "Oh, wait.  I forgot to format it."<p>
With that, she took the disk in both hands and ripped the metal door off.<p>
"There," she said, pleased with herself.<p>
It took all the self-control I could possibly muster to retain my composure
and suggest she buy another disk.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>User:</b>  "I've gotta print a paper out tonight.  Do you have a printer?"
<li><b>SysAdmin:</b>  "Sure.  Mac or PC?"
<li><b>User:</b>  "Umm, I'm not sure.  It says Smith Corona on it."
<li><b>SysAdmin:</b>  "Ok, so it's a typewriter with a screen, right?"
<li><b>User:</b>  "Yep.  Will these things read my disk?"
</ul>
Well, some of these typewriters can write MSDOS format disks, so it's possible.
<ul>
<li><b>SysAdmin:</b>  "Possibly.  Do you have your disk?"
<li><b>User:</b>  "Yes, it's right here!"
</ul>
She hands me her disk.  Unfortunately, it's not a writeable disk.  In fact,
it's not a disk at all.  It's a yellow plastic insert, most definitely a
piece of shipping packaging.
<ul>
<li><b>SysAdmin:</b>  "Umm, did your typewriter give you any errors when you
 saved your work?"
<li><b>User:</b>  "I think so, but they didn't look important.  Is there
 anything wrong?"
</ul>
Now, here's where years of living with teachers comes in handy.  Can
<em>you</em> imagine trying to keep a straight face?
<ul>
<li><b>SysAdmin:</b>  "Well, ma'am, this is not a disk.  It's packaging, meant
 to keep the innards of your disk drive from beating themselves
 up when the thing's on the road.  Nothing can get stored on
 this, unless you wish to carve a message on it with an x-acto knife."
<li> <b>User:</b>  "Oh."
