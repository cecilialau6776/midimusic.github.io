<H3>2.6 Disk Drives</H3>
<blockquote>
<h4>Like many other computer components, disk drives also undergo a wide variety
of abuse due to ignorance of their function.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "You've sent me a disk but it doesn't seem to fit into
 the drive.  It seems to be an inch too long."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "In order to make the disk fit into the drive, you
 have to make sure that the metal shield is toward the computer,
 and that the round wheel is downward."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ahh, that's better, but it still doesn't work."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "You have to push the disk in until the blue button
 pops out."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh, now it works!  How come it doesn't say that anywhere?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A woman in a non-computer-related company attempted to install a large
software package, requiring multiple 5 1/2" disks to install from.  She
placed disk 1 in drive A:, as instructed.  Slightly bewildered when the
computer prompted her for disk 2, she nevertheless obliged.  But when it
asked her to insert disk 3, she went to an office-mate and insisted that
another disk would not fit in the drive.
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine was providing UNIX support for a Large Company (which
shall remain nameless).  One of his users called up one day to report a
problem on a DOS machine.  Apparently, her floppy drive was giving general
failure error messages when writing new files.
<p>
My friend dutifully trotted down there to look at the problem.  He
foolishly neglected to bring a replacement for the drive.  When he arrived,
he found that this woman had put a floppy in with the little plastic disk
sleeve still in it.  The head was trashed and the drive had to be replaced.
<p>
About three months later, this same woman calls back with the same problem.
This time my friend, now savvy to the wiles of this particular user,
grabbed a replacement drive, then trotted on down to visit.  When he got
there, he found the drive with <em>two</em> 3.5" floppies shoved into it all
the way.  When he asked why (big mistake), she replied, "I was out of high
density disks, so I figured I could just use two low density ones instead."
<p><hr><p>
I once received a call from a customer who was determined he had a failing
hard drive.  The problem was that his computer wouldn't boot to Windows unless
it tried three or four times in succession.  His explanation was that this was
because the hard drive wasn't "spinning far enough" to find the file it
needed to boot.  After each attempt, though, the hard drive would spin far
enough over until finally it could find the file it needed to boot.
<p>
Needless to say, that wasn't it.
<p><hr><p>
I had a call from our Science Librarian that her floppy drive wouldn't
accept any disks.  Our librarians misassume that they are all power
users, and she had taken it upon herself to disassemble the drive (it was
an external drive to a laptop) and couldn't visually find a problem, so
she asked that I order a new one.  Well, policy is to inspect a part
ourselves before ordering a new one, so I went to her office to check the
drive.  When I got there she demonstrated that one could not insert a floppy
into the drive.  But I noticed that instead of the eject button being below and
to the right of the slot, it was above it and to the left.
I turned the drive over, inserted a disk, and, amazingly, considering that
she had taken the thing apart, it worked fine.
<p><hr><p>
I work for a company that does technical support for a floppy drive
manufacturer. I got a call from a customer who was absolutely hysterical
saying that she was going to report us to the Attorney General
because we were selling a product that was worthless. After
finally getting her calmed down enough to talk fairly rationally, the
conversation went something like this:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What seems to be the problem with our drives?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "They don't work! I've had three of the &amp;*@$# things
 and none of them work. It's against the law to sell a product that
 you know is worthless, and you're not going to get away with it any longer!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What's the problem with them?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "They won't let me write to the disk! You people
 ought to be ashamed of yourselves!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Does it give you any kind of error message?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "You're %#^$%@ right it does! The same one every &amp;*^#@
 time! They all say, 'Write protect error reading drive A:'! What's
 the use of a floppy drive if you can't write to the &amp;*#&amp;$* thing!?"
</ul><p>
At that point I put the customer on mute for a few moments while I
composed myself, summoned some patience and self-control, and
explained to her how to solve that problem. Did she apologize? Of
course not! She flew into another tirade that we didn't include
sufficient documentation with our product and wanted to know what we
were going to do to reimburse her for her time and inconvenience.
<p><hr><p>
A young lady came and asked why she could not open a file that she had
saved to the network.  I went with her to the PC she was using and opened
the file in question without difficulty.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Me</b>:  "That seems ok."
<li><b>Her</b>:  "Yes, it's ok here, but when I get home and look in my
 college folder on the C: drive, it's not there.  I want this fixed.
 I'm already late handing in my assignment."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
The customer called to order a new hard disk drive for his computer.
He wanted a 20 meg hard drive (this was some time ago) for his IBM PS/2.
He received the drive but called back, complaining that it was the wrong
thing.  He said he didn't need a hard drive but rather a 3 1/2" floppy drive.
And if we couldn't get him a 3 1/2" floppy drive that would store 20 megs,
he didn't want it and would go elsewhere.
<p><hr><p>
A "cannot access drive A:" error turned out to be due to a user putting
the 5 1/4" diskette in the tiny gap between drives A: and B: and then
closing the drive A: door.
<p><hr><p>
A tech advised a customer to put his troubled floppy back in the
drive and close the door.  The customer put his phone down and was
heard walking across the room and shutting the door to the room.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Can I get a hard drive with a cdrom drive built into it?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
In the process of doing a backup on a Mac, I was once given this peculiar instruction:
<p><ul>
<li> "Please insert disk drive."</ul>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What do I do now?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "One way to resolve this would be to delete
 files to free up space."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Which files should I delete?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Delete files that you have created that you no longer need."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I can't do that.  ALL of my files are important.  Isn't
 there another way?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Well, you could get a bigger hard drive."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "A BIGGER HARD DRIVE!  The thing already takes up
 most of my desk space.  How much bigger does it have to be?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>A Friend</b>:  "Does my hard drive get heavier when I put mor data on it?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I had a call from a customer who said that his floppy drive recently stopped
reading disks.  I suggested that he clean out the dust from the drive.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I can't."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Huh?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "The dust won't move."
</ul>
Finally, I found out that he had been using spray glue near the machine.
<p><hr><p>
A customer came into our store one day wanting to buy a tape-backup drive.
Normally this wouldn't have been a problem, but that day the only drives
we had in stock required a 1 meg per second floppy controller.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'll take that 3.2 gig tape backup drive."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Do you know what kind of floppy controller you have?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Of course I do.  It's on my motherboard."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Do you know how fast it is?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "That's none of your business."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Is it 1 meg per second?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "You don't need to know that."
<li><b>Me</b>: "The only motherboards we carry that support this drive are
 the P-II motherboards, so..."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I didn't buy my board here."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Well, this drive will only work if you have a 1 meg per--"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Look here, son, I know more about
 computers from working in the field than you get out of your college
 classes.  I know what I'm talking about.  Sell me the drive."
</ul><p>
I sold him the drive.  He returned it the next day.
His floppy controller wasn't fast enough.
<p><hr><p>
We used to supply Xenix systems. For some obscure reason Xenix's <em>fsck</em>
command required the name of a scratch file during startup on every boot. One
customer typed in <em>/dev/hdroot0</em> -- the root disk block device -- as
the scratch file and consequently wiped the whole hard disk. He typed this,
he explained, because it was displayed on the screen just before the scratch
file question.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What exactly happened?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I tried to download netscape, but the
 connection kept dropping."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, then what?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, I couldn't find the file to delete it, so
 I formatted my hard drive."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes. Do you know somewhere I can download DOS?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I talked to a guy whose wife taught computer classes.  At the start of her
class, she had her students bring in a floppy disk and format it.  This was
roughly 1986 or 1987, so it was a good place to start.  But at the
beginning of the first class period, she was greeted by a technician who
informed her that all the computers had been upgraded with hard drives.  She
thought that was great.
<p>
So when class started, she told her students that they would use hard drives
rather than their floppies.  First step: <kbd>format C:</kbd>.
<p>
After telling me this story, the teacher's husband laid all the blame on the
tech who installed the hard drives.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My hard drive is messed up."
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Could you give me the error message or the problem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I added up all the space taken up in the folders,
 and there should be more space free on the hard drive."
</ul><p>
My jaw dropped at this point.  This guy had actually taken the time to
physically add up all the space taken up by his files and directories in
File Mangler.  Turns out, he didn't add the sub-directories into the
equation.  Oops.
<p><hr><p>
A customer called complaining that his new computer had a hard drive problem.
When asked to describe this, he told me he ran out of space on his C: drive.
<p>
I spent fifteen minutes trying to explain that the drive was segmented into
three partitions -- C:, D:, and E:, and all he had to do was use the available
installer on his desktop to change the installation path.
<p>
He responded that that couldn't be right, because he had friends with
computers, and none of them ever had to do that.  He refused the read the
manual, do what I suggested, or call anyone else for support.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "All my files I saved last week to my C: drive are missing!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Do you remember what directory you first saved them in?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, I don't. I just know it was on my C: drive."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Ok, I'll walk you through how to find the files."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I wouldn't think I would be losing files on this
computer.  Gee, I just had the hard drive replaced in it yesterday."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Thank you for calling. How can I help you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Help!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What's the problem, sir?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My drive started making funny noises, so I put my
 finger in it to see what was wrong, and now I CAN'T GET IT OUT!!"
</ul>
After muting the customer for a few seconds to regain his composure, I
calmly suggested that the man hang up and call 911.  The funniest part is
that this guy actually waited on hold for over ten minutes before he was
able to reach a tech.
<p><hr><p>
A customer brought in a Macintosh SE with a diskette stuck in the
disk drive.  Even using a paper clip in the manual eject hole would
not eject the disk.  Upon disassembling the disk drive, I
discovered why.  The customer had a fondness for carrying 3.5"
disks in his front shirt pocket.  He had also put his Visa Gold
Card in his front pocket that day.  It managed to lodge itself on
the back of the disk by slipping under the metal shutter.  Without
knowing, he had inserted the disk, Visa and all, into the drive.
The customer charged the repair fee.
<p><hr><p>
I have a user who travels with his zip drive.  He is constantly forgetting
to plug one end of the cable into the computer, and the other end into the
zip drive.  He instead, plugs both ends into the zip drive, forming a loop,
which is in no way hooked to the computer.
<p><hr><p>
I had a user who had pulled a 3 1/2" floppy out of a disk drive with pliers
because she "didn't know what that little button was for."  She had left all
the metal parts inside the drive and then had the gall to ask if the
data was ok and get irate when we told her no.
<p><hr><p>
A friend had a brilliant idea for saving disk space.  He thought if he
put all his Microsoft Word documents into a tiny font they'd take up less
room.  When he told me, I was with another friend.  He thought it was a
good idea too.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "My disk ran out of space when trying to save my Word
 document, so I changed it from double spaced to single spaced
 and it <em>still</em> wouldn't fit!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A customer called complaining that his "hard drive won't boot."  After
determining there was a floppy disk in the A: drive, I suggested that the
customer remove it.  Later, when I arrived, I found he had successfully
removed the entire floppy drive from the machine.
<p><hr><p>
A woman dialed tech support for a large computer manufacturer. She complained
that her computer was "eating" her disks.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Eating your disks?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well I've inserted over twenty of them and still can't
 save to the floppy drive."
</ul><p>
After a long frustrating call, the customer service representative sent a
tech over to the woman's home.  He was dumbfounded by what he saw.<p>
One of the front face plates on the case was missing.  Inside the computer,
at the bottom of the case, were exactly twenty floppy disks in a pile.
<p><hr><p>
Back when the PS/2 first came out I was setting up a bunch of
machines for a Big Eight accounting firm here in Chicago.
Management at the company did not want their users having floppy
drives because that was just another hole for a virus to enter
their network.  The funny thing about those old PS/2's is that the
front of the CPU had the disk slot and eject mechanism even if
there was no drive in the bay (later fixed, of course).  Thus, we
send email out to everyone describing this anomaly and put tape
over the disk slot.  Needless to say, after a mere month, nearly
every CPU had diskettes lying on the motherboard.
<p><hr><p>
A customer said the floppy drive on her Mac wasn't working.  The case had a
nice rectangular 3 1/2" hole in the front, but there was no sign of the diskette.
I popped open the cover, and there was the diskette sitting on the
motherboard.  Only then did I notice two or three pieces of plastic
sitting next to the monitor.  A question or two solved the mystery.
The computer had been purchased without a floppy drive, so a cosmetic plastic
snap-in strip had been placed over the empty floppy hole.  She had pried the
strip out with a nail file and shoved the floppy in.  I put the case down
as a "customer attempted upgrade."
<p><hr><p>
A girl from my class (a blonde) once called me and complained that her
computer would not boot up anymore.  I asked her what she had done.  She
calmly replied, "Oh, I simply opened the hard disk properties tab and
pressed the 'compress' button to increase the capacity.  But it was taking
too much time, and I got bored, so I shut it off."
