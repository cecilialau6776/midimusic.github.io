<H3>2.2 Memory</H3>
<blockquote>
<h4>
Computer memory is very frequently misunderstood.  One, it is
not physically seen or directly manipulated by the user.
Two, measurement of its quantity is not expressed in terms familiar
in other contexts. Three, the size of hard disks, also not physically seen by
the user, are measured using the same units.

<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Memory? Is that the RAM stuff?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>

<li><b>Customer</b>: "...I just had 60 more of them RAMs installed..."

I had called the electronics department of a chain department store to ask
how much their RAM was.  The clerk who answered the phone asked me, "Is that
that CD-RAM stuff?"  I decided it was better to drive over there and see for
myself.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I just put on DOS/Windows 6.0, and my memory crashed the system."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "How much RAM do you have in the computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "32 megs."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Are you using any RAM doubling software?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Yes."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "So you have 16 megs of actual, physical RAM?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No.  I have 8 megs.  I installed [a RAM expanding
 product], and that gave me 16.  I liked it so much I went out
 and got [another RAM expanding product].  So now I have 32."
</ul>

<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Can you send me a disk to increase my RAM to the 64 meg maximum?"

A woman brought her Macintosh LC520 into my shop to have more memory
added.  This was all fine, but she said she the computer kept running out of
memory at startup.  I found this to be rather interesting and decided to fire
it up at the counter while she watched.<p>
After plugging in the computer to the wall and a keyboard and mouse I hit
the power button.  The computer sounded to life and the screen lit with the
"Welcome to Macintosh" box on screen.  This was immediately replaced by
the Mac/OS picture and a status bar that was progressing as the extensions
loaded.  As the bar approached the end she said, "See the memory is all full."
I looked at her rather confused and asked where she would have gotten that
idea.  Apparently one of the know-nothings at the local computer superstore
had said that that was what the progress bar meant.<p>
Needless to say she was rather angry at them for the erroneous information.
She ending up not buying the RAM but was thankful for our good service.

A customer called in at MicroSystems Warehouse and said he needed to
speak to a tech immediately.  I asked him what the problem was and that I
might be able to help.  He said, "Are the SIMM slots located in the back of
the computer?"  I asked him if he needed help installing the chips.  He said,
"No.  I installed them and the computer just isn't recognizing them."  I said
to him, "Where did you install the chips?"  He said, "I removed my sound
card and put them in there."
<p><hr><p>
I got a guy who was trying to remove a 4 meg SIMM from his LC III so he
could install an 8 meg SIMM.  He complained that he was having trouble
with it -- it appeared to be soldered in.  I asked him if he had released the
SIMM from the clips; he said he had to rip one of them off.  He said the ends
could wiggle free, but the middle looked like it was soldered in.  I tried to
understand what the heck was going on in his Mac...the weirdness went on for
at least five minutes.  Finally, grasping for some semblance of reality,
I asked how much memory his LC III had.  Four megs.  He looked at the
directions again -- "Ohhhhh, you gotta take it out if you have <em>more</em>
than four megs."  He was removing the SIMM <em>slot</em>.<p>
He asked if he should solder it back down.

<li><b>Customer</b>:  "You people owe me a new computer."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "You're having trouble with your computer?  What
 seems to be the problem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, I bought some memory from you people, and ever
 since I installed it into my computer, it's been doing nothing
 but making grinding noises, and nothing works anymore!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Grinding noises??  It shouldn't be doing that!"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I know that!  That's why you people owe me a new
 computer, and I'm going to charge you for lost downtime and my inconvenience."
</ul><p>
Grinding noises from SIMMs?  This was a new one.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sir, did you install those chips yourself or
 did someone do it for you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I'm not an idiot!  I did it myself.  I put them
 right in that slot in the front of the computer, smart aleck."
