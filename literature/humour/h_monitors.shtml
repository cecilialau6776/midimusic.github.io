<H3>2.3 Monitors</H3>
<blockquote>
<h4>
You'd think people would realize that a monitor is similar
to a TV.  It receives a signal that represents an image, then
displays said image.

<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Please click on the 'start' button."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "What 'start' button?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "In the lower left hand corner there is a button
 that says 'start'."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "There is no button."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "You are using Windows NT?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes. The button is on the right hand side, and there is
 a little green light next to it.  You want me to push that?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "No sir, that's the power button. Is there a gray
bar across the bottom of the screen with buttons on it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "There is no gray bar.  It is white, and it opens, and
 there are buttons inside."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No. Sir, on the TV part of the monitor is there a
gray bar that you can point at with the mouse, using the cursor that
is on the screen."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "There are some dials. There is one that has a picture of
 a sun on it, but I don't have any idea what those are for."
</ul><p>

A new technician was sent into the field to install a new video
card.  About the time they began to wonder if something was wrong,
the technician called in.  "I have the monitor apart, I just can't
figure out where to install the video card."
<p><hr><p>
I had a very irate user call me:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I need someone to fix this $&amp;%^* computer.  It keeps
 going off, and when I push the silver power button in the back to
 turn it on, it shocks the ^#@&amp;%* out of me.  It does this to me four
 or five times a day!"
</ul><p>
I told him I would come down and look at it.  When I examined the terminal,
I found that the fuse holder in the back had worked loose, and
the cap had fallen off and gotten lost.  The fuse would slowly slide out
from the vibrations on the desk, and the terminal would shut down.  The user
would reach around the terminal and push on the bare fuse with his finger.<p>
You'd think one or two of those shocks would have been enough.
<p><hr><p>
I received a call from a medical facility.  They were trying to
get a 286 with an amber screen working.  They brought it in
saying that the screen wasn't showing the prompt and several of
the menu options.  We turned on the machine and sure enough, some
stuff was missing.  Me and my tech partner contemplated trying a
different monitor, to see if the card was still good.  Suddenly, on
impulse, I reached back and turned the contrast knob up.
Suddenly, there were the missing menu options and the prompt.  We
put "contrastual adjustment" on the bill.
<p><hr><p>
Last week, I installed a computer for a co-worker.  It was the very
first computer she had ever used.  She called me early the next morning
and said her monitor was fuzzy looking and wanted to know if she needed
to buy an antenna for it.
<P>
I told her no, it was cable ready.
<p><hr><p>
I work with second and third line support in a bank in Norway. We have about
600 users, but we have one that I actively try to avoid.<p>
The first time she called and said her monitor didn't work. I got up there,
and it looked fine. I tried to explain that there was probably something
wrong with the software, but she insisted it was the monitor, so I changed
it just to make her shut up. The next day she called and said it happened
again.  The new monitor, she said, didn't work either.  I went up to see.
The monitor was fine; she had just exited Windows somehow and was at the
MS-DOS prompt.  Before I could explain this to her, she said:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Her</b>:  "Maybe it's the keyboard that's broken?  Or the mouse?
 Or the printer?  It could be the printer, right?"
<li><b>Me</b>:  "No."
</ul><p>
A few weeks later I had to check how much memory the computers on that floor
had.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Her</b>: "What are you doing?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "I'm checking how much memory these computers have."
<li><b>Her</b>: "Oh.  That's like the strength of the monitor, right?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "No."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
For a while, my monitor at home had been acting up, and unbeknownst to
me, my father had went and bought a reformatting disk which he believed
would fix the monitor. One day, I got home and found that the monitor
had given out, and he had put in his 'repair disk' to 'save' our hard
drive. He fumbled through the program without any display, and the end
result was the deletion of everything on the hard drive.
<p><hr><p>
When my son turned on his new computer for the first time, the following
message box appeared:<p>
<ul>
<li> "Press and release the monitor power button if it is not on or blinking already."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What's on the screen?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "The what?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "The monitor -- what's on the monitor?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hold on......what?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What's on the screen right in front of you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hold on...I'll call you back."  <em>(click)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My monitor is wavy."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Your monitor is wavy.  Hmmm.  Is it on?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Huh...urm...uhh.  Nope."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What are you on?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Hehehe...ohh yeah...thanks."  <em>(click)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Received at our help desk:<p>
<kbd>
The computer won't boot.  User replaced the monitor, plugged it in, and
the computer still won't boot.  Need assistance ASAP.
</kbd>
<p><hr><p>
A user called to ask us if we had any nuclear radiation shielding
screens in stock.  (All he wanted was an anti-glare screen for his
monitor.)
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What's on your screen right now?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "A stuffed animal that my boyfriend got me at the
 grocery store."
</ul>
The proper response to this, of course, is:
<ul>
<li> "For heaven's sakes!!  Get that thing off there!!!!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
The Assistant Manager over engineering called to say that her PC had suddenly
started acting up, the words she was typing were bouncing all over the place.
Fellow tech went to check on her PC and discovered that she'd moved her
electric fan from her desk to the top of her monitor.
<p><hr><p>
I ran the computer department for a collection company and one day a
user walked up to me and told me she had received a payment in that
day, but her screen wasn't flashing to notify her (the right corner of
the screen normally would reverse color and flash 'Payment Received').
Then she went on to tell me that she was pretty sure the bulb was just
burned out and needed to be replaced.
<p><hr><p>
One time, several employees complained about having green lettering when they
wanted amber.  One employee got mad at me because I "wouldn't" change the
screen color -- because, after all, all I had to do was put in an
"orange fuse."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "THIS MONITOR DOESN'T WORK."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What seems to be the problem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "THIS MONITOR IS MISSING A PIN!!"
</ul><p>
This guy had a 14 inch monitor.  As with most, the monitor cable's plug was
missing a few unnecessary pins.  I explained that this was normal and, in
fact, a good thing.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I PAID FOR A MONITOR WITH ALL THE PINS. I WANT THEM ALL!"
