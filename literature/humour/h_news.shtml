As if mucking up email wasn't bad enough, newsgroups provide
a way for people to send messages to computers across the
world all too easily.

I recently got an irate piece of e-mail from someone arguing that the First
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guaranteed his right to post off-topic
messages in newsgroups.
<p>
He was posting and mailing from Canada.

I'm a regular reader of rec.sport.fencing.  What I hate is the people who
post articles with the subject line, "Fencing."

When I came to the NG, it showed that there were lots o
unread mail.  When I opened the group, it showed 4 items.
Is it me?  OR  Is it AOL?  Perhaps the entire internet, even.
just curious!

<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I have a problem with Usenet news."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Um, sir, you shouldn't be calling me in the first
 place, send mail to support--"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "But this is very important, and maybe affecting a
 lot of subscribers!  Please listen to me."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  (well, he did say please)  "Ok, what's the problem?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "There's nothing interesting on Usenet.  It's all
 mindless crap, and as one of the larger Internet providers,
 you must take liability for this!"
