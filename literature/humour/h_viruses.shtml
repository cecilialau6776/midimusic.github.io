<blockquote><h4>
If computers alone don't throw the average user into fits
of paranoia, computer viruses will.  But as with other
aspects of computing, this deep concern fails to prompt any
attempt on the user's part to learn the facts.

About two years ago, I was asked to run a virus scan on one company's
network of computers. I did and I found a simple harmless virus on each
computer in the network. After I reported that to the company's officials,
they gasped (literally), then thanked me, then asked me to leave despite
my offers to remove the virus with the anti-virus program. The next day, I
found out that they formatted every single hard drive of every computer,
backing up only the most important data.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "My hard disk has a virus!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "How can you tell?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "When I type 'DIR', it says 'VIRUS &lt;DIR&gt;' and
 some date stuff."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Excuse me, there is an empty-folder virus on my disk."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A user called to inform us that his laptop had a virus. When we asked
why he though he had a virus, he promptly explained that he must have a
virus as his system would no longer fit in the docking station. It was
later determined that it had a faulty port on the back of the system.
<p><hr><p>
One day at school, I was lending a friend a couple of my CD games.  Then
a girl came up and said, "I wouldn't do that if I were you.  You might
get it back with a virus on it."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "YOU GAVE ME A VIRUS!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "I don't think I've got a virus."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Go download <em>[a brand of virus checker]</em>, and you'll see."
</ul><p>
Sometime later I dutifully ran the checker.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, I ran it.  No virus."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "You MUST have a virus.  You gave it to me.  It
 was all over my system.  You must not have run the checker properly."
 <em>(yell, rant, rave, repeat checks, etc)</em>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "How did I give it to you?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "On those floppies with the latest revision of the
 software you wrote."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "The ones you just returned?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yeah."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Just a sec...let me check those."  <em>(pause)</em>
 "Well, I found a virus on the disks.  Ahem...seems you were about to
 pass a virus on to ME."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Ah...lemme get back to you."  <em>(click)</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A mailing list that dispenses computer-related tips and tricks each day
once sent out the following dubious virus prevention tip:<p>
<blockquote>
Virus Information of the Day: Lock your floppies
<p>
If you're using a diskette only to read information, why not lock it
first? Just flip the "switch" up on the top-left corner on the back of
the diskette. That way, you can prevent diskette-transferred viruses
from being loaded onto your PC. If you need to access a diskette that
you'll need to write to, scan it with your antivirus software.
</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine came around in a bit of a panic, saying
that his dad's machine looked like it had a virus.  He asked if I had any
anti-virus software I could lend him.  I gave him a self-extracting
archive of a virus detection program on a floppy disk.  Foolishly, this
archive was named <em>antvirus.exe</em>. A week later he came back,
saying that his dad had looked at the disk and assumed that this
was a virus, so he'd formatted the disk.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I need you to tell me what browser I am using. Is it
 Netscape 2.0? The reason I need to know is that I have read that
 Netscape 2.0 distributes a virus called Java."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Yes, this is the land [sic] administrator for floor 27.
 Can you tell me if we'll be getting the Michaelangelo virus here at the bank?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Back in the early 90s the programming staff in our office were still
using dumb terminals to do mainframe programming. The department
installed a dedicated PC to share files over a modem with other
departments off site. People in the office began to use the machine for
'unofficial' purposes such as playing games after hours. Management saw
this and, afraid of someone introducing a virus, installed password
protection software on the machine (which also prevented the machine
from being booted from a floppy disk to bypass the security). 
Shortly afterwards the machine began performing erratically and
occasionally lost files. Our technical support group examined the
machine and found a virus. Puzzled as to how a virus could have been
introduced into a protected machine, they examined the various pieces of
software in the office. It was found that the virus had come from the
disk that had been used to install the password protection software onto
the machine (in an attempt to protect the machine from viruses). 
Unfortunately, the anti-virus software they had on hand needed to be
loaded from a bootable floppy disk to prevent infection of the diskette.
However, as previously mentioned, the security software had disabled the
boot function of the floppy disk drive. They finally ended up
reformatting the entire drive to get rid of the virus.
<p><hr><p>
While working on the helpdesk of a local community college, I came
across a message on one of our tech support forums.  The author of this
message was convinced that there was a virus in his BIOS, and he later
started accusing us of sending him it.  He was convinced that our
computers were sending the virus straight to his hard drive through the "modem
subcarrier" (his words) between keystrokes while he was dialed in
to his shell account.
<p><hr><p>
The computer security people at one large organization warned everyone of
the dreaded "RedTeam" email virus, including a printout of the dire warning
they had been sent concerning it.  All attempts to let them know that
(1) viruses can't be sent by email (outside of an attachment, anyway), and
(2) the innoculation software provided for it is allegedly a very real virus,
were merrily ignored. (The BubbleBoy virus <b>can</b> be sent by email. It is a Visual
Basic script which runs when an infected email is opened and replicates
by sending itself to everyone in your Outlook Express Address Book).
<p><hr><p>
I checked my email one morning when getting into work and
read a message from our Human Resources department warning
us about the latest dreaded email virus.  After laughing
myself silly, I decided to reply, just to have some fun with them.  I
asked them for more information on the "virus" so I could protect my system.
<p>
They told me what to look for by forwarding me a copy
of the email message that was supposedly a virus.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Sorry to bother you again, but I think my son threw a
 stone in my PC.  It tells me, 'Your PC is Stoned!'"
</ul>
(The common "stoned" virus displays this message on infected computers.)
<p><hr><p>
Once, in the computer cluster, a student asked me to move my disks because
they were close to her own, and she didn't want them to catch a virus.
<p><hr><p>
I received a call from the PA to the Finance Director, (the owner of 28% of our
tech support calls for that year). She reported that one of her floppy disks
had caused our virus checker to flash a very alarming message.  I asked her
to put the disk to one side until I arrived.  When I made it to her office,
I was directed to a corner desk where a disk box had been set up with a yellow
post-it note reading "Quarantine."  She explained she had put the disk in this
separate disk box so it wouldn't infect the other floppies.
<p><hr><p>
A customer came in to the store one day with a Macintosh.  I had
just replaced a bad drive in the thing a few days previously.  She
complained that it wasn't working again, implying that I didn't fix
it right the first time.  So, I get out the diagnotic tools, but can't
find a thing wrong with it.  I then checked some of the diskettes she
brought in with it and find that they are loaded with viruses.  After
cleaning up the diskettes, I explained to her that her computer
probably got the virus by trading diskettes with someone whose computer
was also infected.  She then got a very sullen expression on her face
and asked me, "Can a person catch this virus from their computer?"
<p><hr><p>
The computer service tech where I work told me he got a call from
a secretary complaining that the floppy drive in her computer
wouldn't work.  He went down to check it out and found that she was
putting the discs in <em>with</em> the plastic dust sleeves still on them.
He asked her why on earth she was doing that and she said, "Well,
I didn't want my computer to get a virus."
<p><hr><p>
I work for the internal tech support of a company.  One day I received an
amusing call.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I found a bug in my computer."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "How do you know it's really a bug?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I can see it."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "You can physically see a bug in your computer?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yes."
</ul><p>
This was definitely worth a trip to his office.  When I got there, I saw an
anti-virus warning, which included a graphic of a hand holding a bug.  I
explained that the anti-virus software had discovered a virus on his system.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, can you give me another computer so I can let
 this one rest and recover for a couple of days?"
</ul><p>
I cleaned the virus off his system and told him his computer was feeling
better now.
<p><hr><p>
I received a call from a woman. She had been
told in a previous call that her computer was infected by a trojan virus
and wanted to know where to begin disinfecting the computer.   I asked her
what software she was using, but she sounded a little confused.
After a few minutes, I learned that she had dismantled her computer and was
preparing to wipe everything down with Lysol, a disinfecting cleaner.
<p>
It took me another minute to compose myself and try to tell her to stop
before she ruined her computer.  I don't know if she did, as I never heard
from her again -- and it took me ten minutes to stop laughing.
<p><hr><p>
I walked into the English department's computer lab one day and saw
two English teachers staring blankly at a computer screen that
contained the message, "Non-system disk error; Remove and press any key."
One of them confidently said, "It's got to be a virus -- those damn kids
are always putting those things on our network."
<p><hr><p>
A friend of mine once found a boot sector virus in one of his computers
and had tried to repair it by changing the motherboard.  He was getting
frustrated because the virus kept reappearing.
<p><hr><p>
Several years ago my job at the time was to support testing of a group
of custom microelectronics products.  This involved working with several
of the customer's programmers, one of whom obviously knew everything
(just ask him) and was a gift to the programming world (ask him again).
Naturally, he wasn't very popular.
<p>
One day while this fellow was at lunch another programmer modified the
prompt command in his AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  (This was during the DOS days.)
The modification changed the default setting to one that showed a
Bart Simpson face, complete with flashing eyes.
<p>
The "gift to programming" returned from lunch. After a few minutes of
quiet mutterings, he jumped up and ran around warning everyone at the
top of his lungs that there was a virus in the system.
<p><hr><p>
I worked for a health insurer that was making the big move
from PCs to networked PCs. They hired a network administrator whose mindset
was security above all -- he was somewhere far to the right of General
Patton. One facet of the conversion was the changeover from Okidata
dot matrix printers to HP Laserjets. We were using DisplayWrite, which
stores the printer information with the document file.
<p>
Inevitably, a nurse tried to print an Okidata-formatted document on a
Laserjet, producing pages of gibberish. Panicking, she called the network
administrator.
<p>
He took one look at what was printing, bellowed "We've got a virus!" and,
before anyone could figure out what was happening, had reformatted her
hard drive.
<p><hr><p>
I was in the local Circuit City store, when I saw a demo Sony
Playstation game unit, and I went over to try it out. The controller
would not work -- it had apparently been disconnected from the game unit.
I told this to a passing salesman, and he said, "Oh no sir, it doesn't
work because the controller has a virus."
<p>
I asked him how he thought the controller contracted the virus. He
said it was because the display used to be near the computer section of
the store, and they had moved it away from the computers "to see if it
would get better."
