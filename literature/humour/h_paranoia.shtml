<H3>4.1 Paranoia</H3>
<blockquote><h4>
A great many people are daunted by the power and complexity of
computers and are deathly afraid of them.  Sometimes warnings
about viruses or hackers on TV magazine programs scares the
living daylights out of people, complicating the issue.
Paranoia is an integral part of the role computers play in
society today.  But some people take it to gross extremes.

<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, I just want to know if I load this disk into my
 computer, won't other people be able to get into my computer
 and access everything I have in there?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, that's not possible."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "You see it on the TV all the time."

About a year ago, a customer from Roswell, NM, called in to place an order.
To break the ice, I jokingly asked if he or any of his neighbors had seen
any aliens lately.  The guy laughed and proceeded to tell me all about the
crazies (his word, not mine) that not only live in Roswell but who come on
vacation there in hopes of seeing a UFO themselves.  As he talked, I
processed the order, and the last bit of information I needed to complete it
was the guy's email address for marketing purposes.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Email!  I won't have anything to do with that
 Internet or modems of any sort!  You should be careful about those.
 Don't you know that once you install a modem, the government can
 look into your computer and watch everything you do?  That's why
 every night before I go to bed, I turn the monitor to the wall."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
At the end of the eighties I was working for a company that made software
for doctor's offices. I frequently gave demonstrations to small groups of
physicians. One of the main concerns was safety. There was
so much talk about hackers.  Would their patient records be safe from
intruders? I explained to them that one could only get into a computer from
outside the office if the modem was on, and the computer was running a
communication program and acting as a host. At that time, this was a rare
situation in private practice. But even the most powerful argument I
could think of, "You can't break into a computer that's turned off," did
not have the impact I had hoped for. One way or the other they were convinced
that a clever hacker would not be stopped by such a trivial problem!

A customer called saying he was getting an error in Windows 95.  He told me
what the error was, and I recognized this as a typical error that occurs after
installing MS Office 97.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sir, did you just install Office 97?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "YOU'RE IN MY COMPUTER, AREN'T YOU?????"

</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes, ma'am, we require a credit card or checking
 account in order to sign up on our service."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, I saw on the news that I should <em>never</em>
 give out my credit card information!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, ma'am, we have to have a way to bill you."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No <em>other</em> service does this!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "No, ma'am, the others don't allow you to use a
 checking account."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "No honest company would ask me for my credit card information!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "May I have your phone number, sir?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don't give out my phone number!"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "All right.  How may I help you, sir?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "How much for your Internet service?"
</ul>
I gave him the prices.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "If I own the software why do you keep charging for it?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, sir, the software is free, but you are
 charged for being online."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "YOU CONNECT YOUR COMPUTER TO THE PHONE LINE?!?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well, sir, you do use a modem to dial online."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I WILL NEVER HOOK MY COMPUTER TO MY PHONE!!!!"

The second day I worked doing phone tech support, I was called by an elderly
woman who was sobbing and panicked. After spending twenty minutes getting
her calmed down, I finally found out what her problem was. She had been on the
Internet and recieved the ever-popular message "This program has performed an
illegal operation and will be shut down."  Immediately afterward, she had heard
police sirens down the road and thought, "They're coming to lock me up!"
<p><hr><p>
I work as a computer tech at a community college.  Most of our computers are
currently running Windows 95.  One day, an officer from our security
department stopped by to talk to me.  His face looked grim.  
He pulled me quietly aside.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Officer</b>: "We have a new part time person working in our
 office who uses the computer, and I have to ask you something, but
 you need to keep this confidential."  
<li><b>Me</b>:  "Ok, what's the problem?"  
<li><b>Officer</b>: "Well, over the past two or three days I've glanced over
 at the new person's computer, and several times I've seen a
 message that says 'You have performed an illegal operation,' but he
 keeps clearing it by clicking something.  I need to find out what
 he's doing wrong and if we should call the local police."
</ul><p>
He looked so scared and serious, I had a hard time containing my laughter.
<p><hr><p>
One of my users recently came into the workforce and is literally terrified
of her computer.  Each sound it makes be it from the speaker or random
drive noises causes her to flinch and turn pale.  She sits at a
custom-built wraparound desk surrounded by her computer, the
switchboard, an electric typewriter (she hates that too), and the postal
meter.  In order to point at the screen I have to stand directly behind her
chair.
<p>
She was having great problems with the telecoms software convincing
herself that she really had downloaded the file.  In order to demonstrate
that the "dir" command would show her that her files really were in the
directory I chose the c:\dos directory to use it on.
<p>
When the dozens of filenames flickered down the screen she was so
panicked that she thrust her chair backwards crushing me between the
chair and the typewriter.
<p>
To simplify things, I installed Windows 95 and demonstrated how to move
files from the folder to the trash can.  Later I wandered by her desk and
noticed a forest of icons surrounding her trash can.  She hadn't managed to
hit it once.
<p><hr><p>
I work for a nationwide ISP, doing overnight technical support.  A man
who had immigrated from Croatia called to ask us, in his thick eastern
European accent, mind you,  why we were kicking him offline.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Why do you guys keep kicking me offline?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Can you hold on a moment while I look at your account logs?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Sure, but please hurry."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok." ... "Hi, thanks for holding.  It looks like
 our servers are reporting that either your modem is hanging up
 like a normal disconnect, or the connection is just being lost.
 This is usually attributed to line noise.  I'd advise you get in touch with--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, that is not what it is!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Well, that would normally be the first place I'd
 look.  The modems are just losing touch with each--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:   "All right.  Apparently they do not tell you
 everything there. What I'm trying to look at are some Croatian
 newspapers to keep up with what's going on in my old country.
 The government did not like me when I was there and they do not
 like me being in touch with my family and events there today."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Sir, the government there cannot disconnect you
 from the Internet here.  You are in the United St--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My government was very powerful.  They can do lots
 of things you would never imagine."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "I'm sure in Croatia, the government would have the
 power to disconnect you from the Internet.  The service providers
 are under their jurisdiction there.  However, in America, there is
 nothing they could do to force our computers to knock you off line.
 You're safe.  I'm telling you, the first and foremost place I'd look
 is the telephone company to have them do what's called a 'data grade check'--"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, no, no.  That is alright.  I just wanted to know
 if you were doing it intentionally, or if it was them.   Thank you.
 Thank you.  Have a good night."
</ul>

At 3:37 a.m. on a Sunday, I had just looked at the clock to
determine my annoyance level, when I received a frantic phone call from
a new user of a Macintosh Plus.  She had gotten her entire family
out of the house and was calling from her neighbor's.  She had just
received her first system error and interpreted the picture of the
bomb on the screen as a warning that the computer was going to
blow up.
