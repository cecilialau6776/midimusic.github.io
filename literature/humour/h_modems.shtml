<blockquote>
<h4>Everybody wants to experience the Internet.  There's only one
problem...there's a little piece of hardware you need to buy first.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
Overheard in a classroom just prior to an animal science class at the
University of New Hampshire:
<ul>
<li><b>Student #1:</b>  "Yeah, she told me all about the -- what is it? --
 Internet.  Except you need this...thing...for your
 computer...to connect to it...what's it called?...oh yeah, a modem."
<li><b>Student #2:</b>  "Ooooooo, aren't we special?  We know the
 <em>technical</em> term!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Seeing the light, at last:
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Oh!!  You mean I need a modem <em>and</em> a computer
 to get on the Internet!?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Do you really need a modem to connect to the Internet?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes, ma'am, you do."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Do you really, really need one?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes, ma'am, I am afraid that you do."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "WELL, THAT'S DUMB!!!!"  <em>[click]</em>
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
I recall a conversation that my mother and I had about five years ago.  I had
been begging and pleading with my mom to let me sign up with an ISP for
Internet access, but the answer was always no.  Eventually, after months of
whining, she agreed.  I was thrilled and I told her I would go price modems
that day.  "Hold on," she said.  "What are you talking about modems?"
<p>
I explained to her that in order to connect our computer to the phone line,
we would need a modem.  "Forget that," my mother bellowed.  "We'll get the
Internet now, but the modem can wait until next year."
<p><hr><p>
One day, a tech sitting near me received a call from a feeble old
gentleman with a southern drawl.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I'm having trouble receiving my email."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What email client are you using?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Email client?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Yes, the program that you use to get your email."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Program?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Yes, program...what operating system are you on?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Operating system?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Yes, operating system...do you see a start button
 in the bottom left hand corner?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Bottom left hand corner of what?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  <em>(agitated)</em> "Of the SCREEN."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "What screen?"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  <em>(about to die)</em> "The screen,
 the monitor, the thing in front of you that looks like a TV."
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Oh, I don't have one of those."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: <em>(recomposing himself)</em>  "What kind of
 computer do you have, sir?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Computer?  I don't have one of them things."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "What DO you have?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: <em>(proudly)</em>  "A modem."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sir.  You need a computer to send and receive
 email.  A modem won't work by itself."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Well, dammit...I have a modem, and the guy at Best Buy
 said this was <em>all I'd need</em> to get online!  I want to cancel
 my account!  I'm not spending no damn two thousand dollars on a computer!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I want to lodge a formal complaint about this modem
 you people sold me."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your
 new modem.  What seems to be the problem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "One of your reps, who claimed he was technical,
 sold me this modem and a cable and even convinced me to buy some
 antivirus stuff and told me that that's all I need to get onto the Internet."
</ul><p>
Thinking that perhaps the rep may have sold a DB9 cable when the customer
had a DB25 Comm port, I innocently asked, "Well, what model computer do you
have?"<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  <em>(extremely irritated sigh)</em>  "That's the
 problem!  He never told me I needed a <em>computer</em>!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A customer rang up reporting that his modem had been recently connecting at
really slow speeds and occasionally dropped connections.  I asked him how long
the problem had been happening, and he replied, "Just after I put the new phone
in upstairs."
<p>
It turned out there were six phones (three upstairs and three downstairs, two
of which were cordless), two faxes, and a burglar alarm (that alerts the
police online) all on one phone line.
<p>
Even worse, the user had all of these connected into two sockets via a network
of extension cables and double adapters.  The modem, for example, was connected
to an extension cord on a reel and then through a surge protector.  The
extension cord was fifty feet long, of which only five feet were used -- the
rest was still wound on the reel.
<p>
I was surprised that he was even able to connect at all. Needless to say,
once the number of phones was reduced to two, his modem started connecting
reliably again.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "How fast does your modem go?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It's not moving, it's just sitting there."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li> "My modem needs a new hard drive."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
Friday, a gentleman called and complained about not being able to connect
to the system.  His modem was dialing but it would not make the connection,
stopping before it prompted him for his username.  He said, "I don't see why
I'm not getting connected.  The modem is getting a good strong signal -- it's
loud."  I tried to explain that the sound of the modem connecting and the
volume didn't really have that much to do with the connection.  He insisted
that he should be getting connected since he was getting "a good strong
connection."
<p><hr><p>
Checking on a customer's connection problem, I discovered that the modem
was listed five times in the system's driver list.  I wondered about this,
and then the customer said, "Well, maybe I do have five modems in my laptop!"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "My modem can't see my Windows!"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Why can't I call more than one BBS with one modem
 at a time? This IS a MULTITASKING system, isn't it??"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
A lady said that her computer was dialing last night but in the
morning she couldn't get in.  I asked her if she had an external
or internal modem.  She said that she had an external modem.  I
told her to turn her modem off and then back on.
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok...the screen is black now."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "You turned off your modem, or your computer?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "My modem."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "How big is your modem?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, it's about two feet high and about a foot wide."
</ul>
I explained that it wasn't her modem, it was her computer and her
modem was inside of the big box.
<p><hr><p>
I went to a library to access the Internet on their brand new computers.  
Usually I can just sit down and click on Netscape Navigator, but that 
day the monitor was blank.  I tried the monitor's power button several
times.  I looked all over for the computer, but I couldn't find it.
<p>
So I asked the librarian to help me.  He pointed out the tower case hidden
in a cubbyhole and said, "There's your problem.  The modem's not turned on."
He flipped the power switch, and the computer hummed to life.  "That's the
modem," he informed me.  "It won't work without the modem."
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Friend</b>: "Isn't that on the modem?"
<li><b>Me</b>: "No...the modem is the thing that makes noise when you
 get on the Internet."
<li><b>Friend</b>: "Yeah, I know what the modem is, I thought the printer
 was hooked up to it. Haha."
<li><b>Me</b>: "No, the only thing the modem connects to is the phone line."
<li><b>Friend</b>: "My game pad connects to the modem too."
<li><b>Me</b>: "No, it doesn't."
<li><b>Friend</b>: "Yeah, it does."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Trust me -- it doesn't. I don't care what kind of computer
 set up you have, it doesn't connect to the modem. The modem is for
 telephone communication only."
<li><b>Friend</b>: "It does too. I'm looking at it right now. I know what I see."
<li><b>Me</b>: "Game pads connect to a game port.  Modems don't have game ports."
<li><b>Friend</b>: "I have a tower modem, and everything connects to it."
</ul><p>
I laugh hysterically.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Friend</b>: "Well, then what does the modem connect to? It's not the computer."
</ul><p>
Chances are, she thought the monitor was the computer.
<p><hr><p>
I work for an ISP.  One day I had the following conversation with a customer:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "How dare you do this!!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sorry sir, how dare we do what?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I paid you 2000 pounds for this machine."  <em>(As if
 we, the ISP, had sold him the thing.)</em>  "I'll be
 seeing you in court if you don't initialise this machine now!"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Sorry sir?  What exactly does it say?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "'Cannot Initialise Modem'."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What brand is your modem?"
</ul>
The customer dutifully read the brand name off the modem's packaging:
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It's a Ziplock brand modem."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
While on the phone to a customer regarding a problem with a
LaserWriter, I finally managed to work out that she had the
printer cable in the comm port instead of the printer port.
I asked her to remove the cable from the comm port and place it
in the printer port.  Seconds later, the phone line went dead.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "The modem keeps saying 'No Dial Tone.'"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Is it plugged into a phone jack?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It has to be plugged into a phone jack?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Is there any other way to do it? I don't have a phone
 jack in that room."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>: "I'm getting 'No DNS Errors'."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is the modem dialing?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No.  I could get in ok last night."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, well, what has happened since last time you could connect?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I had a clash between the modem and the mouse last
 night so I removed the modem.  Do you think that has something to do with it?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
My sister called me once, complaining that her modem didn't work.  When
I looked at her computer, I discovered she had connected the modem to the
phone line, but hadn't put the modem in the computer -- it was lying on
top.
<p><hr><p>
About four months ago we upgraded all of our modem banks to 56K x2.  We spent
a great deal of time switching all of our customers to the new system.  One
custom er (who had previously inquired about a job as a technician) decided
that since we upgraded, he would do the same.  So he called one day and
explained that he had bought a brand new US Robotics 56K modem.  He had it
all hooked up and installed, but the modem didn't seem to be getting a
dial tone.  I asked him a bit about his new modem as well as his old one.
He explained to me that his old modem was an internal, while his new modem
was an external.  So I walked him through checking his dialup networking
to make sure it using his new modem and not the old one (figuring it was
probably attempting to use the old modem which was not connected to the
phone line).  Everything appeared fine, so I asked him to make sure he had
the phone line plugged in properly from the new external modem to the wall.
<p>
"To the wall?" he replied.
<p>
I, in turn, say, "Yes, the phone line needs to go from the external modem into
the phone jack on the wall."
<p>
He, seemingly somewhat surprised, replied, "Well, if I disconnect it from the
back of the computer, how is my computer going to connect?"
<p>
He had cleverly hooked his phone line from his new external modem directly
into his old internal modem.  Needless to say, we didn't hire him.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I'm thinking about getting a T1 modem, and I was
 wondering where I could purchase one and how much it would cost?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>

<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  <em>[heavy southern accent]</em> "My 'puter ain't connectin' to your alls'."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What type of computer do you have?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Hue-klin Pack-in."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Pardon?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Huuueklinn Paackinnn...."
</ul>
Hewlett-Packard??
<p>
After some basic Windows navigating, it becomes apparent that the modem isn't
plugged in correctly.

<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Do you see a phone cord running between the
 computer and the wall jack?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  (hesitantly)  "Yes-s-s-s."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Where it plugs into the computer, what does it have written?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I don' know.  It's in da back of da 'puter ya say?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Yes.  You may have to turn the computer around to see it."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I ain't ganna do that!  There ain't nothin' wrong wi'
 my 'puter!  There's somethin' on your all's side that's ----ed up."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "It says <em>NO CARRIER</em>.  Why does it say that?
 I know they put one in there."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Hello?  I'm trying to dial in.  I installed the
 software ok, and it dialed fine.  I could hear that.  Then I could hear
 the two computers connecting.  But then the sound all stopped,
 so I picked up the phone to see if they were still connected,
 and I got the message, 'No Carrier,' on my screen.  What's wrong?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I get 'receive no carrier from modem'."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Where is that music coming from?  Sounds like I am on hold."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "From my phone line."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "There is your problem.  You have line noise.  You
 have a radio station coming through your phone line."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Ok...I will try and log on when the station goes off the air."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I noticed a speed difference in the dial-up lines from
 28.8 to 9600 bps.  I was wondering if I was doing something
 wrong or if this was normal."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "If I hook up 2 of these 9600 baud modems, will I get 19200?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
My mom and I had just gotten our computer back after having it fixed. It
was hooked up, and I soon found out that I had no sound. When I
connected on the Internet for the first time, however, the dial tone came
through the speakers. It turned out the speakers were connected to the modem,
not the sound card.
<p><hr><p>
Overheard as my boss was talking to a co-worker:
<ul>
<li><b>Boss:</b>  "Yeah, I can't really get any higher than vee dot
 twenty-eight eight biz on my modem at home, and I'm lucky if I
 get vee dot nineteen point two biz."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I just got a 28.8 modem, but I'm not getting any better
 speed.  There's something wrong on your end, and I want to know
 when you're gonna get it fixed."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "What type of computer do you have?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "I have a 386sx-16 with 4 megs of RAM, but the problem's
 not on my end.  It's on yours.  So when are you going to get it fixed?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "During that bad thunderstorm last night, lightning
 struck the telephone pole outside while I was online.  Ever
 since then your modems haven't been working.  When are you
 going to get 'em fixed?"
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
There was a woman who bought a modem for her Mac IIsi.  She called and wanted
to know how to use it to do virtual reality.
<p><hr><p>
I was working at a company that manufactured internetworking
hardware for minicomputers, providing in-house support for other
employees of the company.  One day, a user buzzed me on the
intercom and asked, "Is the computer down?"  Since I was reading
and did not actually know the answer to her question, I sat up
quickly and began typing on my terminal to see if the computer had
crashed when I wasn't looking.  It hadn't.  I replied, "No, it's
up."  "Well, I can't log on," was the reply.  When I got to the
user's office, I checked the obvious things:  the terminal was
plugged in and turned on, the keyboard was plugged in and the
lights showed "online."  I reset the terminal -- no effect.  I
checked the terminal settings (baud rate, parity, etc), all
correct.  Finally, in desperation, I craned my neck around the back
side of the terminal and noticed that there was one and only one
cable running into the rear of the box -- the power cable.  I asked
the user where the other cable was (the serial connection to the
mini) and was told, "Oh, it's over here.  I moved my terminal this
morning.  Is this thing important?"
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "All right, flip the power switch on the back of
 the modem. Are they lit up now?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "No, still not on."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Is the modem plugged in?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "Uhh..."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "On the back of the modem, there are three cables.
 One goes to the terminal, one is the phone line, and the third is the
 power cord. Where does that third cable go?"
<li><b>Customer</b>: "That cable goes to the keyboard."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "No, I don't think it does. Try following the cable again."
<li><b>Customer</b>: "It really does go to the keyboard. In fact, the
 keyboard that y'all sent didn't fit into any of the
 holes in the modem, so I had to use the one from my own computer...but
 that fits in nicely."
</ul><p>
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Right, so Windows isn't detecting your modem at all?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "No, I go through the add new hardware wizard,
 and it can't see anything new at all."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, do you have an internal or an external modem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Internal."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Can you run through how you installed the modem, please?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Well, I took it out of the box, switched off the
 computer, and put it in the slot, then turned the computer back on again."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>: "Hmmm.  What brand of modem is it?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I don't know."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "What does it say on the box?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "v.90 PCMCIA fastcard"
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Are you using a desktop PC?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yea, it's a mid tower."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Where exactly did you put the modem?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "In the slot, you know, the one in the front."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "The same place you put floppy disks?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Yeah, that's the one."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Ok, it sounds pretty bad. Please bring the modem
 back in for a full refund. Your computer isn't compatible with modems."
</ul>
I would have felt guilty letting someone like that on the net.
<p><hr><p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Hi.  I can't get your damn service to work.  I'm
 really upset about all of this.  You're ripping me off, and
 I'm not going to let you get away with it."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Well sir, what exactly is the problem you're
 experiencing connecting to our service?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well I set everything up like you told me to, and I
 double clicked on the logon icon and nothing happened."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Can you hear your modem dialing sir?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "My what?"
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Your modem, sir.  It's the device that lets your
 computer communicate with ours over your phone line.  You must
 have one to access us."
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well dammit, you didn't tell me I needed one of those.
 You damn people are always trying to screw people out of
 money some way or another, with all of these hidden costs."
<li><b>Tech Support:</b>  "Sir, how exactly did you think your computer was
 going to connect to ours without utilizing a phone line, or
 some medium of communication?"
<li><b>Customer:</b>  "Well, uhh, I guess I...uhh...."
</ul>
<p><hr><p>
One customer was having problems connecting and was getting incorrect password
errors.  I asked him his username (we often get calls from users of another
ISP with a name similar to our own). Sure enough, he was a user.
<p>
I checked his modem drivers and configuration but kept turning up empty.
Finally I asked which socket at the back of the modem the cable was plugged
into.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "Neither."
<li><b>Tech Support</b>:  "Neither?"
<li><b>Customer</b>:  "I didn't want to incur any overseas toll charges
 so I didn't hook the modem into the phone line. To get rid of those
 annoying 'No Dialtone' error messages, I looked through the manual
 and found the ATX3 command and decided to use that."
