<h3 id="A161">161. The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar
Hunter</h3>

<p>A BULL finding a lion's cub asleep gored him to death
with his horns. The Lioness came up, and bitterly lamented the
death of her whelp. A wild-boar Hunter, seeing her distress,
stood at a distance and said to her, &quot;Think how many men
there are who have reason to lament the loss of their children,
whose deaths have been caused by you.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A162">162. The Oak and the Woodcutters</h3>

<p>THE WOODCUTTER cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in pieces,
making wedges of its own branches for dividing the trunk. The Oak
said with a sigh, &quot;I do not care about the blows of the axe
aimed at my roots, but I do grieve at being torn in pieces by
these wedges made from my own branches.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Misfortunes springing from ourselves
are the hardest to bear.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A163">163. The Hen and the Golden Eggs</h3>

<p>A COTTAGER and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every
day. They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of gold
in its inside, and in order to get the gold they killed it.
Having done so, they found to their surprise that the Hen
differed in no respect from their other hens. The foolish pair,
thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of
the gain of which they were assured day by day.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A164">164. The Ass and the Frogs</h3>

<p>AN ASS, carrying a load of wood, passed through a pond. As he
was crossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled and
fell, and not being able to rise on account of his load, groaned
heavily. Some Frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation,
and said, &quot;What would you do if you had to live here always
as we do, when you make such a fuss about a mere fall into the
water?&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Men often bear little grievances with
less courage than they do large misfortunes.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A165">165. The Crow and the Raven</h3>

<p>A CROW was jealous of the Raven, because he was considered a
bird of good omen and always attracted the attention of men, who
noted by his flight the good or evil course of future events.
Seeing some travelers approaching, the Crow flew up into a tree,
and perching herself on one of the branches, cawed as loudly as
she could. The travelers turned towards the sound and wondered
what it foreboded, when one of them said to his companion, &quot;Let
us proceed on our journey, my friend, for it is only the caw of a
crow, and her cry, you know, is no omen.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Those who assume a character which
does not belong to them, only make themselves ridiculous.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A166">166. The Trees and the Axe</h3>

<p>A MAN came into a forest and asked the Trees to provide him a
handle for his axe. The Trees consented to his request and gave
him a young ash-tree. No sooner had the man fitted a new handle
to his axe from it, than he began to use it and quickly felled
with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest. An old oak,
lamenting when too late the destruction of his companions, said
to a neighboring cedar, &quot;The first step has lost us all. If
we had not given up the rights of the ash, we might yet have
retained our own privileges and have stood for ages.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A167">167. The Crab and the Fox</h3>

<p>A CRAB, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighboring green
meadow as its feeding ground. A Fox came across him, and being
very hungry ate him up. Just as he was on the point of being
eaten, the Crab said, &quot;I well deserve my fate, for what
business had I on the land, when by my nature and habits I am
only adapted for the sea?&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Contentment with our lot is an
element of happiness.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A168">168. The Woman and Her Hen</h3>

<p>A WOMAN possessed a Hen that gave her an egg every day. She
often pondered how she might obtain two eggs daily instead of one,
and at last, to gain her purpose, determined to give the Hen a
double allowance of barley. From that day the Hen became fat and
sleek, and never once laid another egg.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A169">169. The Ass and the Old Shepherd</h3>

<p>A SHEPHERD, watching his Ass feeding in a meadow, was alarmed
all of a sudden by the cries of the enemy. He appealed to the Ass
to fly with him, lest they should both be captured, but the
animal lazily replied, &quot;Why should I, pray? Do you think it
likely the conqueror will place on me two sets of panniers?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; rejoined the Shepherd. &quot;Then,&quot; said the
Ass, &quot;as long as I carry the panniers, what matters it to me
whom I serve?&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">In a change of government the poor
change nothing beyond the name of their master.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A170">170. The Kites and the Swans</h3>

<p>TEE KITES of olden times, as well as the Swans, had the
privilege of song. But having heard the neigh of the horse, they
were so enchanted with the sound, that they tried to imitate it;
and, in trying to neigh, they forgot how to sing.</p>

<p class="reditalic">The desire for imaginary benefits
often involves the loss of present blessings.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A171">171. The Wolves and the Sheepdogs</h3>

<p>THE WOLVES thus addressed the Sheepdogs: &quot;Why should you,
who are like us in so many things, not be entirely of one mind
with us, and live with us as brothers should? We differ from you
in one point only. We live in freedom, but you bow down to and
slave for men, who in return for your services flog you with
whips and put collars on your necks. They make you also guard
their sheep, and while they eat the mutton throw only the bones
to you. If you will be persuaded by us, you will give us the
sheep, and we will enjoy them in common, till we all are
surfeited.&quot; The Dogs listened favorably to these proposals,
and, entering the den of the Wolves, they were set upon and torn
to pieces.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A172">172. The Hares and the Foxes</h3>

<p>THE HARES waged war with the Eagles, and called upon the Foxes
to help them. They replied, &quot;We would willingly have helped
you, if we had not known who you were, and with whom you were
fighting.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Count the cost before you commit
yourselves.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A173">173. The Bowman and Lion</h3>

<p>A VERY SKILLFUL BOWMAN went to the mountains in search of game,
but all the beasts of the forest fled at his approach. The Lion
alone challenged him to combat. The Bowman immediately shot out
an arrow and said to the Lion: &quot;I send thee my messenger,
that from him thou mayest learn what I myself shall be when I
assail thee.&quot; The wounded Lion rushed away in great fear,
and when a Fox who had seen it all happen told him to be of good
courage and not to back off at the first attack he replied:
&quot;You counsel me in vain; for if he sends so fearful a
messenger, how shall I abide the attack of the man himself?&quot;
</p>

<p class="reditalic">Be on guard against men who can
strike from a distance.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A174">174. The Camel</h3>

<p>WHEN MAN first saw the Camel, he was so frightened at his vast
size that he ran away. After a time, perceiving the meekness and
gentleness of the beast's temper, he summoned courage enough
to approach him. Soon afterwards, observing that he was an animal
altogether deficient in spirit, he assumed such boldness as to
put a bridle in his mouth, and to let a child drive him.</p>

<p class="reditalic">Use serves to overcome dread.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A175">175. The Wasp and the Snake</h3>

<p>A WASP seated himself upon the head of a Snake and, striking
him unceasingly with his stings, wounded him to death. The Snake,
being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his
enemy, saw a wagon heavily laden with wood, and went and
purposely placed his head under the wheels, saying, &quot;At
least my enemy and I shall perish together.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A176">176. The Dog and the Hare</h3>

<p>A HOUND having started a Hare on the hillside pursued her for
some distance, at one time biting her with his teeth as if he
would take her life, and at another fawning upon her, as if in
play with another dog. The Hare said to him, &quot;I wish you
would act sincerely by me, and show yourself in your true colors.
If you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard? If an enemy, why
do you fawn on me?&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">No one can be a friend if you know
not whether to trust or distrust him.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A177">177. The Bull and the Calf</h3>

<p>A BULL was striving with all his might to squeeze himself
through a narrow passage which led to his stall. A young Calf
came up, and offered to go before and show him the way by which
he could manage to pass. &quot;Save yourself the trouble,&quot;
said the Bull; &quot;I knew that way long before you were born.&quot;
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A178">178. The Stag, the Wolf, and the Sheep</h3>

<p>A STAG asked a Sheep to lend him a measure of wheat, and said
that the Wolf would be his surety. The Sheep, fearing some fraud
was intended, excused herself, saying, &quot;The Wolf is
accustomed to seize what he wants and to run off; and you, too,
can quickly outstrip me in your rapid flight. How then shall I be
able to find you, when the day of payment comes?&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Two blacks do not make one white.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A179">179. The Peacock and the Crane</h3>

<p>A PEACOCK spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a Crane that
passed by, ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying,
&quot;I am robed, like a king, in gold and purple and all the
colors of the rainbow; while you have not a bit of color on your
wings.&quot; &quot;True,&quot; replied the Crane; &quot;but I
soar to the heights of heaven and lift up my voice to the stars,
while you walk below, like a cock, among the birds of the
dunghill.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Fine feathers don't make fine birds.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A180">180. The Fox and the Hedgehog</h3>

<p>A FOX swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force
of the current into a very deep ravine, where he lay for a long
time very much bruised, sick, and unable to move. A swarm of
hungry blood-sucking flies settled upon him. A Hedgehog, passing
by, saw his anguish and inquired if he should drive away the
flies that were tormenting him. &quot;By no means,&quot; replied
the Fox; &quot;pray do not molest them.&quot; &quot;How is this?&quot;
said the Hedgehog; &quot;do you not want to be rid of them?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; returned the Fox, &quot;for these flies which you
see are full of blood, and sting me but little, and if you rid me
of these which are already satiated, others more hungry will come
in their place, and will drink up all the blood I have left.&quot;
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A181">181. The Eagle, the Cat, and the Wild Sow</h3>

<p>AN EAGLE made her nest at the top of a lofty oak; a Cat,
having found a convenient hole, moved into the middle of the
trunk; and a Wild Sow, with her young, took shelter in a hollow
at its foot. The Cat cunningly resolved to destroy this chance-made
colony. To carry out her design, she climbed to the nest of the
Eagle, and said, &quot;Destruction is preparing for you, and for
me too, unfortunately. The Wild Sow, whom you see daily digging
up the earth, wishes to uproot the oak, so she may on its fall
seize our families as food for her young.&quot; Having thus
frightened the Eagle out of her senses, she crept down to the
cave of the Sow, and said, &quot;Your children are in great
danger; for as soon as you go out with your litter to find food,
the Eagle is prepared to pounce upon one of your little pigs.&quot;
Having instilled these fears into the Sow, she went and pretended
to hide herself in the hollow of the tree. When night came she
went forth with silent foot and obtained food for herself and her
kittens, but feigning to be afraid, she kept a lookout all
through the day. Meanwhile, the Eagle, full of fear of the Sow,
sat still on the branches, and the Sow, terrified by the Eagle,
did not dare to go out from her cave. And thus they both, along
with their families, perished from hunger, and afforded ample
provision for the Cat and her kittens.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A182">182. The Thief and the Innkeeper</h3>

<p>A THIEF hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the
hope of stealing something which should enable him to pay his
reckoning. When he had waited some days in vain, he saw the
Innkeeper dressed in a new and handsome coat and sitting before
his door. The Thief sat down beside him and talked with him. As
the conversation began to flag, the Thief yawned terribly and at
the same time howled like a wolf. The Innkeeper said, &quot;Why
do you howl so fearfully?&quot; &quot;I will tell you,&quot; said
the Thief, &quot;but first let me ask you to hold my clothes, or
I shall tear them to pieces. I know not, sir, when I got this
habit of yawning, nor whether these attacks of howling were
inflicted on me as a judgment for my crimes, or for any other
cause; but this I do know, that when I yawn for the third time, I
actually turn into a wolf and attack men.&quot; With this speech
he commenced a second fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf,
as he had at first. The Innkeeper, hearing his tale and believing
what he said, became greatly alarmed and, rising from his seat,
attempted to run away. The Thief laid hold of his coat and
entreated him to stop, saying, &quot;Pray wait, sir, and hold my
clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces in my fury, when I turn
into a wolf.&quot; At the same moment he yawned the third time
and set up a terrible howl. The Innkeeper, frightened lest he
should be attacked, left his new coat in the Thief's hand
and ran as fast as he could into the inn for safety. The Thief
made off with the coat and did not return again to the inn.</p>

<p class="reditalic">Every tale is not to be believed.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A183">183. The Mule</h3>

<p>A MULE, frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn,
galloped about in a very extravagant manner, and said to himself:
&quot;My father surely was a high-mettled racer, and I am his own
child in speed and spirit.&quot; On the next day, being driven a
long journey, and feeling very wearied, he exclaimed in a
disconsolate tone: &quot;I must have made a mistake; my father,
after all, could have been only an ass.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A184">184. The Hart and the Vine</h3>

<p>A HART, hard pressed in the chase, hid himself beneath the
large leaves of a Vine. The huntsmen, in their haste, overshot
the place of his concealment. Supposing all danger to have passed,
the Hart began to nibble the tendrils of the Vine. One of the
huntsmen, attracted by the rustling of the leaves, looked back,
and seeing the Hart, shot an arrow from his bow and struck it.
The Hart, at the point of death, groaned: &quot;I am rightly
served, for I should not have maltreated the Vine that saved me.&quot;
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A185">185. The Serpent and the Eagle</h3>

<p>A SERPENT and an Eagle were struggling with each other in
deadly conflict. The Serpent had the advantage, and was about to
strangle the bird. A countryman saw them, and running up, loosed
the coil of the Serpent and let the Eagle go free. The Serpent,
irritated at the escape of his prey, injected his poison into the
drinking horn of the countryman. The rustic, ignorant of his
danger, was about to drink, when the Eagle struck his hand with
his wing, and, seizing the drinking horn in his talons, carried
it aloft.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A186">186. The Crow and the Pitcher</h3>

<p>A CROW perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find
water, flew to it with delight. When he reached it, he discovered
to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not
possibly get at it. He tried everything he could think of to
reach the water, but all his efforts were in vain. At last he
collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them one
by one with his beak into the pitcher, until he brought the water
within his reach and thus saved his life.</p>

<p class="reditalic">Necessity is the mother of invention.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A187">187. The Two Frogs</h3>

<p>TWO FROGS were neighbors. One inhabited a deep pond, far
removed from public view; the other lived in a gully containing
little water, and traversed by a country road. The Frog that
lived in the pond warned his friend to change his residence and
entreated him to come and live with him, saying that he would
enjoy greater safety from danger and more abundant food. The
other refused, saying that he felt it so very hard to leave a
place to which he had become accustomed. A few days afterwards a
heavy wagon passed through the gully and crushed him to death
under its wheels.</p>

<p class="reditalic">A willful man will have his way to
his own hurt.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A188">188. The Wolf and the Fox</h3>

<p>AT ONE TIME a very large and strong Wolf was born among the
wolves, who exceeded all his fellow-wolves in strength, size, and
swiftness, so that they unanimously decided to call him &quot;Lion.&quot;
The Wolf, with a lack of sense proportioned to his enormous size,
thought that they gave him this name in earnest, and, leaving his
own race, consorted exclusively with the lions. An old sly Fox,
seeing this, said, &quot;May I never make myself so ridiculous as
you do in your pride and self-conceit; for even though you have
the size of a lion among wolves, in a herd of lions you are
definitely a wolf.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A189">189. The Walnut-Tree</h3>

<p>A WALNUT TREE standing by the roadside bore an abundant crop
of fruit. For the sake of the nuts, the passers-by broke its
branches with stones and sticks. The Walnut-Tree piteously
exclaimed, &quot;O wretched me! that those whom I cheer with my
fruit should repay me with these painful requitals!&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A190">190. The Gnat and the Lion</h3>

<p>A GNAT came and said to a Lion, &quot;I do not in the least
fear you, nor are you stronger than I am. For in what does your
strength consist? You can scratch with your claws and bite with
your teeth as a woman in her quarrels. I repeat that I am
altogether more powerful than you; and if you doubt it, let us
fight and see who will conquer.&quot; The Gnat, having sounded
his horn, fastened himself upon the Lion and stung him on the
nostrils and the parts of the face devoid of hair. While trying
to crush him, the Lion tore himself with his claws, until he
punished himself severely. The Gnat thus prevailed over the Lion,
and, buzzing about in a song of triumph, flew away. But shortly
afterwards he became entangled in the meshes of a cobweb and was
eaten by a spider. He greatly lamented his fate, saying, &quot;Woe
is me! that I, who can wage war successfully with the hugest
beasts, should perish myself from this spider, the most
inconsiderable of insects!&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A191">191. The Monkey and the Dolphin</h3>

<p>A SAILOR, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to
amuse him while on shipboard. As he sailed off the coast of
Greece, a violent tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and
he, his Monkey, and all the crew were obliged to swim for their
lives. A Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and
supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend),
came and placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in
safety to the shore. When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in
sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he were
an Athenian. The latter replied that he was, and that he was
descended from one of the most noble families in that city. The
Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Pir&aelig;us (the famous harbor
of Athens). Supposing that a man was meant, the Monkey answered
that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate friend.
The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey
under the water and drowned him.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A192">192. The Jackdaw and the Doves</h3>

<p>A JACKDAW, seeing some Doves in a cote abundantly provided
with food, painted himself white and joined them in order to
share their plentiful maintenance. The Doves, as long as he was
silent, supposed him to be one of themselves and admitted him to
their cote. But when one day he forgot himself and began to
chatter, they discovered his true character and drove him forth,
pecking him with their beaks. Failing to obtain food among the
Doves, he returned to the Jackdaws. They too, not recognizing him
on account of his color, expelled him from living with them. So
desiring two ends, he obtained neither.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A193">193. The Horse and the Stag</h3>

<p>AT ONE TIME the Horse had the plain entirely to himself. Then
a Stag intruded into his domain and shared his pasture. The Horse,
desiring to revenge himself on the stranger, asked a man if he
were willing to help him in punishing the Stag. The man replied
that if the Horse would receive a bit in his mouth and agree to
carry him, he would contrive effective weapons against the Stag.
The Horse consented and allowed the man to mount him. From that
hour he found that instead of obtaining revenge on the Stag, he
had enslaved himself to the service of man.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A194">194. The Kid and the Wolf</h3>

<p>A KID, returning without protection from the pasture, was
pursued by a Wolf. Seeing he could not escape, he turned round,
and said: &quot;I know, friend Wolf, that I must be your prey,
but before I die I would ask of you one favor you will play me a
tune to which I may dance.&quot; The Wolf complied, and while he
was piping and the Kid was dancing, some hounds hearing the sound
ran up and began chasing the Wolf. Turning to the Kid, he said,
&quot;It is just what I deserve; for I, who am only a butcher,
should not have turned piper to please you.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A195">195. The Prophet</h3>

<p>A WIZARD, sitting in the marketplace, was telling the fortunes
of the passers-by when a person ran up in great haste, and
announced to him that the doors of his house had been broken open
and that all his goods were being stolen. He sighed heavily and
hastened away as fast as he could run. A neighbor saw him running
and said, &quot;Oh! you fellow there! you say you can foretell
the fortunes of others; how is it you did not foresee your own?&quot;
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A196">196. The Fox and the Monkey</h3>

<p>A FOX and a Monkey were traveling together on the same road.
As they journeyed, they passed through a cemetery full of
monuments. &quot;All these monuments which you see,&quot; said
the Monkey, &quot;are erected in honor of my ancestors, who were
in their day freedmen and citizens of great renown.&quot; The Fox
replied, &quot;You have chosen a most appropriate subject for
your falsehoods, as I am sure none of your ancestors will be able
to contradict you.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">A false tale often betrays itself.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A197">197. The Thief and the Housedog</h3>

<p>A THIEF came in the night to break into a house. He brought
with him several slices of meat in order to pacify the Housedog,
so that he would not alarm his master by barking. As the Thief
threw him the pieces of meat, the Dog said, &quot;If you think to
stop my mouth, you will be greatly mistaken. This sudden kindness
at your hands will only make me more watchful, lest under these
unexpected favors to myself, you have some private ends to
accomplish for your own benefit, and for my master's injury.&quot;
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A198">198. The Man, the Horse, the Ox, and the Dog</h3>

<p>A HORSE, Ox, and Dog, driven to great straits by the cold,
sought shelter and protection from Man. He received them kindly,
lighted a fire, and warmed them. He let the Horse make free with
his oats, gave the Ox an abundance of hay, and fed the Dog with
meat from his own table. Grateful for these favors, the animals
determined to repay him to the best of their ability. For this
purpose, they divided the term of his life between them, and each
endowed one portion of it with the qualities which chiefly
characterized himself. The Horse chose his earliest years and
gave them his own attributes: hence every man is in his youth
impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own
opinion. The Ox took under his patronage the next term of life,
and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to
labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources.
The end of life was reserved for the Dog, wherefore the old man
is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish,
tolerant only of his own household, but averse to strangers and
to all who do not administer to his comfort or to his necessities.
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A199">199. The Apes and the Two Travelers</h3>

<p>TWO MEN, one who always spoke the truth and the other who told
nothing but lies, were traveling together and by chance came to
the land of Apes. One of the Apes, who had raised himself to be
king, commanded them to be seized and brought before him, that he
might know what was said of him among men. He ordered at the same
time that all the Apes be arranged in a long row on his right
hand and on his left, and that a throne be placed for him, as was
the custom among men. After these preparations he signified that
the two men should be brought before him, and greeted them with
this salutation: &quot;What sort of a king do I seem to you to be,
O strangers?&quot; The Lying Traveler replied, &quot;You seem to
me a most mighty king.&quot; &quot;And what is your estimate of
those you see around me?&quot; &quot;These,&quot; he made answer,
&quot;are worthy companions of yourself, fit at least to be
ambassadors and leaders of armies.&quot; The Ape and all his
court, gratified with the lie, commanded that a handsome present
be given to the flatterer. On this the truthful Traveler thought
to himself, &quot;If so great a reward be given for a lie, with
what gift may not I be rewarded, if, according to my custom, I
tell the truth?&quot; The Ape quickly turned to him. &quot;And
pray how do I and these my friends around me seem to you?&quot;
&quot;Thou art,&quot; he said, &quot;a most excellent Ape, and
all these thy companions after thy example are excellent Apes too.&quot;
The King of the Apes, enraged at hearing these truths, gave him
over to the teeth and claws of his companions.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A200">200. The Wolf and the Shepherd</h3>

<p>A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not
attempt to injure one of them. The Shepherd at first stood on his
guard against him, as against an enemy, and kept a strict watch
over his movements. But when the Wolf, day after day, kept in the
company of the sheep and did not make the slightest effort to
seize them, the Shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian of
his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it; and when
occasion called him one day into the city, he left the sheep
entirely in his charge. The Wolf, now that he had the opportunity,
fell upon the sheep, and destroyed the greater part of the flock.
When the Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed, he
exclaimed: &quot;I have been rightly served; why did I trust my
sheep to a Wolf?&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A201">201. The Hares and the Lions</h3>

<p>THE HARES harangued the assembly, and argued that all should
be equal. The Lions made this reply: &quot;Your words, O Hares!
are good; but they lack both claws and teeth such as we have.&quot;

<h3 id="A202">202. The Lark and Her Young Ones</h3>

<p>A LARK had made her nest in the early spring on the young
green wheat. The brood had almost grown to their full strength
and attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their
feathers, when the owner of the field, looking over his ripe crop,
said, &quot;The time has come when I must ask all my neighbors to
help me with my harvest.&quot; One of the young Larks heard his
speech and related it to his mother, inquiring of her to what
place they should move for safety. &quot;There is no occasion to
move yet, my son,&quot; she replied; &quot;the man who only sends
to his friends to help him with his harvest is not really in
earnest.&quot; The owner of the field came again a few days later
and saw the wheat shedding the grain from excess of ripeness. He
said, &quot;I will come myself tomorrow with my laborers, and
with as many reapers as I can hire, and will get in the harvest.&quot;
The Lark on hearing these words said to her brood, &quot;It is
time now to be off, my little ones, for the man is in earnest
this time; he no longer trusts his friends, but will reap the
field himself.&quot;</p>

<h3 id="A203">203. The Fox and the Lion</h3>

<p>WHEN A FOX who had never yet seen a Lion, fell in with him by
chance for the first time in the forest, he was so frightened
that he nearly died with fear. On meeting him for the second time,
he was still much alarmed, but not to the same extent as at first.
On seeing him the third time, he so increased in boldness that he
went up to him and commenced a familiar conversation with him.</p>

<p class="reditalic">Acquaintance softens prejudices.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A204">204. The Weasel and the Mice</h3>

<p>A WEASEL, inactive from age and infirmities, was not able to
catch mice as he once did. He therefore rolled himself in flour
and lay down in a dark corner. A Mouse, supposing him to be food,
leaped upon him, and was instantly caught and squeezed to death.
Another perished in a similar manner, and then a third, and still
others after them. A very old Mouse, who had escaped many a trap
and snare, observed from a safe distance the trick of his crafty
foe and said, &quot;Ah! you that lie there, may you prosper just
in the same proportion as you are what you pretend to be!&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A205">205. The Boy Bathing</h3>

<p>A BOY bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned. He
called out to a passing traveler for help, but instead of holding
out a helping hand, the man stood by unconcernedly, and scolded
the boy for his imprudence. &quot;Oh, sir!&quot; cried the youth,
&quot;pray help me now and scold me afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Counsel without help is useless.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A206">206. The Ass and the Wolf</h3>

<p>AN ASS feeding in a meadow saw a Wolf approaching to seize him,
and immediately pretended to be lame. The Wolf, coming up,
inquired the cause of his lameness. The Ass replied that passing
through a hedge he had trod with his foot upon a sharp thorn. He
requested that the Wolf pull it out, lest when he ate him it
should injure his throat. The Wolf consented and lifted up the
foot, and was giving his whole mind to the discovery of the thorn,
when the Ass, with his heels, kicked his teeth into his mouth and
galloped away. The Wolf, being thus fearfully mauled, said,
&quot;I am rightly served, for why did I attempt the art of
healing, when my father only taught me the trade of a butcher?&quot;
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A207">207. The Seller of Images</h3>

<p>A CERTAIN MAN made a wooden image of Mercury and offered it
for sale. When no one appeared willing to buy it, in order to
attract purchasers, he cried out that he had the statue to sell
of a benefactor who bestowed wealth and helped to heap up riches.
One of the bystanders said to him, &quot;My good fellow, why do
you sell him, being such a one as you describe, when you may
yourself enjoy the good things he has to give?&quot; &quot;Why,&quot;
he replied, &quot;I am in need of immediate help, and he is wont
to give his good gifts very slowly.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A208">208. The Fox and the Grapes</h3>

<p>A FAMISHED FOX saw some clusters of ripe black grapes hanging
from a trellised vine. She resorted to all her tricks to get at
them, but wearied herself in vain, for she could not reach them.
At last she turned away, hiding her disappointment and saying:
&quot;The Grapes are sour, and not ripe as I thought.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A209">209. The Man and His Wife</h3>

<p>A MAN had a wife who made herself hated by all the members of
his household. Wishing to find out if she had the same effect on
the persons in her father's house, he made some excuse to
send her home on a visit to her father. After a short time she
returned, and when he inquired how she had got on and how the
servants had treated her, she replied, &quot;The herdsmen and
shepherds cast on me looks of aversion.&quot; He said, &quot;O
Wife, if you were disliked by those who go out early in the
morning with their flocks and return late in the evening, what
must have been felt towards you by those with whom you passed the
whole day!&quot;</p>

<h3 id="A210">210. The Peacock and Juno</h3>

<p>THE PEACOCK made complaint to Juno that, while the nightingale
pleased every ear with his song, he himself no sooner opened his
mouth than he became a laughingstock to all who heard him. The
Goddess, to console him, said, &quot;But you far excel in beauty
and in size. The splendor of the emerald shines in your neck and
you unfold a tail gorgeous with painted plumage.&quot; &quot;But
for what purpose have I,&quot; said the bird, &quot;this dumb
beauty so long as I am surpassed in song?&quot; &quot;The lot of
each,&quot; replied Juno, &quot;has been assigned by the will of
the Fates - to thee, beauty; to the eagle, strength; to the
nightingale, song; to the raven, favorable; and to the crow,
unfavorable auguries. These are all contented with the endowments
allotted to them.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A211">211. The Hawk and the Nightingale</h3>

<p>A NIGHTINGALE, sitting aloft upon an oak and singing according
to his wont, was seen by a Hawk who, being in need of food,
swooped down and seized him. The Nightingale, about to lose his
life, earnestly begged the Hawk to let him go, saying that he was
not big enough to satisfy the hunger of a Hawk who, if he wanted
food, ought to pursue the larger birds. The Hawk, interrupting
him, said: &quot;I should indeed have lost my senses if I should
let go food ready in my hand, for the sake of pursuing birds
which are not yet even within sight.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A212">212. The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox</h3>

<p>A DOG and a Cock being great friends, agreed to travel
together. At nightfall they took shelter in a thick wood. The
Cock flying up, perched himself on the branches of a tree, while
the Dog found a bed beneath in the hollow trunk. When the morning
dawned, the Cock, as usual, crowed very loudly several times. A
Fox heard the sound, and wishing to make a breakfast on him, came
and stood under the branches, saying how earnestly he desired to
make the acquaintance of the owner of so magnificent a voice. The
Cock, suspecting his civilities, said: &quot;Sir, I wish you
would do me the favor of going around to the hollow trunk below
me, and waking my porter, so that he may open the door and let
you in.&quot; When the Fox approached the tree, the Dog sprang
out and caught him, and tore him to pieces.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A213">213. The Wolf and the Goat</h3>

<p>A WOLF saw a Goat feeding at the summit of a steep precipice,
where he had no chance of reaching her. He called to her and
earnestly begged her to come lower down, lest she fall by some
mishap; and he added that the meadows lay where he was standing,
and that the herbage was most tender. She replied, &quot;No, my
friend, it is not for the pasture that you invite me, but for
yourself, who are in want of food.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A214">214. The Lion and the Bull</h3>

<p>A LION, greatly desiring to capture a Bull, and yet afraid to
attack him on account of his great size, resorted to a trick to
ensure his destruction. He approached the Bull and said, &quot;I
have slain a fine sheep, my friend; and if you will come home and
partake of him with me, I shall be delighted to have your company.&quot;
The Lion said this in the hope that, as the Bull was in the act
of reclining to eat, he might attack him to advantage, and make
his meal on him. The Bull, on approaching the Lion's den,
saw the huge spits and giant caldrons, and no sign whatever of
the sheep, and, without saying a word, quietly took his departure.
The Lion inquired why he went off so abruptly without a word of
salutation to his host, who had not given him any cause for
offense. &quot;I have reasons enough,&quot; said the Bull. &quot;I
see no indication whatever of your having slaughtered a sheep,
while I do see very plainly every preparation for your dining on
a bull.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A215">215. The Goat and the Ass</h3>

<p>A MAN once kept a Goat and an Ass. The Goat, envying the Ass
on account of his greater abundance of food, said, &quot;How
shamefully you are treated: at one time grinding in the mill, and
at another carrying heavy burdens&quot;; and he further advised
him to pretend to be epileptic and fall into a ditch and so
obtain rest. The Ass listened to his words, and falling into a
ditch, was very much bruised. His master, sending for a leech,
asked his advice. He bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a
Goat. They at once killed the Goat, and so healed the Ass.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A216">216. The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</h3>

<p>A COUNTRY MOUSE invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to
pay him a visit and partake of his country fare. As they were on
the bare plowlands, eating there wheat-stocks and roots pulled up
from the hedgerow, the Town Mouse said to his friend, &quot;You
live here the life of the ants, while in my house is the horn of
plenty. I am surrounded by every luxury, and if you will come
with me, as I wish you would, you shall have an ample share of my
dainties.&quot; The Country Mouse was easily persuaded, and
returned to town with his friend. On his arrival, the Town Mouse
placed before him bread, barley, beans, dried figs, honey,
raisins, and, last of all, brought a dainty piece of cheese from
a basket. The Country Mouse, being much delighted at the sight of
such good cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and
lamented his own hard fate. Just as they were beginning to eat,
someone opened the door, and they both ran off squeaking, as fast
as they could, to a hole so narrow that two could only find room
in it by squeezing. They had scarcely begun their repast again
when someone else entered to take something out of a cupboard,
whereupon the two Mice, more frightened than before, ran away and
hid themselves. At last the Country Mouse, almost famished, said
to his friend: &quot;Although you have prepared for me so dainty
a feast, I must leave you to enjoy it by yourself. It is
surrounded by too many dangers to please me. I prefer my bare
plowlands and roots from the hedgerow, where I can live in safety,
and without fear.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A217">217. The Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape</h3>

<p>A WOLF accused a Fox of theft, but the Fox entirely denied the
charge. An Ape undertook to adjudge the matter between them. When
each had fully stated his case the Ape announced this sentence:
&quot;I do not think you, Wolf, ever lost what you claim; and I
do believe you, Fox, to have stolen what you so stoutly deny.&quot;
</p>

<p class="reditalic">The dishonest, if they act honestly,

<hr>

<h3 id="A218">218. The Fly and the Draught-Mule</h3>

<p>A FLY sat on the axle-tree of a chariot, and addressing the
Draught-Mule said, &quot;How slow you are! Why do you not go
faster? See if I do not prick your neck with my sting.&quot; The
Draught-Mule replied, &quot;I do not heed your threats; I only
care for him who sits above you, and who quickens my pace with
his whip, or holds me back with the reins. Away, therefore, with
your insolence, for I know well when to go fast, and when to go
slow.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A219">219. The Fishermen</h3>

<p>SOME FISHERMEN were out trawling their nets. Perceiving them
to be very heavy, they danced about for joy and supposed that
they had taken a large catch. When they had dragged the nets to
the shore they found but few fish: the nets were full of sand and
stones, and the men were beyond measure cast down so much at the
disappointment which had befallen them, but because they had
formed such very different expectations. One of their company, an
old man, said, &quot;Let us cease lamenting, my mates, for, as it
seems to me, sorrow is always the twin sister of joy; and it was
only to be looked for that we, who just now were over- rejoiced,
should next have something to make us sad.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A220">220. The Lion and the Three Bulls</h3>

<p>THREE BULLS for a long time pastured together. A Lion lay in
ambush in the hope of making them his prey, but was afraid to
attack them while they kept together. Having at last by guileful
speeches succeeded in separating them, he attacked them without
fear as they fed alone, and feasted on them one by one at his own
leisure.</p>

<p class="reditalic">Union is strength.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A221">221. The Fowler and the Viper</h3>

<p>A FOWLER, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to
catch birds. Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to
take it, and fitting his twigs to a proper length, watched
intently, having his whole thoughts directed towards the sky.
While thus looking upwards, he unknowingly trod upon a Viper
asleep just before his feet. The Viper, turning about, stung him,
and falling into a swoon, the man said to himself, &quot;Woe is
me! that while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself fallen
unawares into the snares of death.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A222">222. The Horse and the Ass</h3>

<p>A HORSE, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the
highway. The Ass, being heavily laden, moved slowly out of the
way. &quot;Hardly,&quot; said the Horse, &quot;can I resist
kicking you with my heels.&quot; The Ass held his peace, and made
only a silent appeal to the justice of the gods. Not long
afterwards the Horse, having become broken-winded, was sent by
his owner to the farm. The Ass, seeing him drawing a dungcart,
thus derided him: &quot;Where, O boaster, are now all thy gay
trappings, thou who are thyself reduced to the condition you so
lately treated with contempt?&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A223">223. The Fox and the Mask</h3>

<p>A FOX entered the house of an actor and, rummaging through all
his properties, came upon a Mask, an admirable imitation of a
human head. He placed his paws on it and said, &quot;What a
beautiful head! Yet it is of no value, as it entirely lacks
brains.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A224">224. The Geese and the Cranes</h3>

<p>THE GEESE and the Cranes were feeding in the same meadow, when
a birdcatcher came to ensnare them in his nets. The Cranes, being
light of wing, fled away at his approach; while the Geese, being
slower of flight and heavier in their bodies, were captured.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A225">225. The Blind Man and the Whelp</h3>

<p>A BLIND MAN was accustomed to distinguishing different animals
by touching them with his hands. The whelp of a Wolf was brought
him, with a request that he would feel it, and say what it was.
He felt it, and being in doubt, said: &quot;I do not quite know
whether it is the cub of a Fox, or the whelp of a Wolf, but this
I know full well. It would not be safe to admit him to the
sheepfold.&quot;</p>

<h3 id="A226">226. The Dogs and the Fox</h3>

<p>SOME DOGS, finding the skin of a lion, began to tear it in
pieces with their teeth. A Fox, seeing them, said, &quot;If this
lion were alive, you would soon find out that his claws were
stronger than your teeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">It is easy to kick a man that is down.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A227">227. The Cobbler Turned Doctor</h3>

<p>A COBBLER unable to make a living by his trade and made
desperate by poverty, began to practice medicine in a town in
which he was not known. He sold a drug, pretending that it was an
antidote to all poisons, and obtained a great name for himself by
long-winded puffs and advertisements. When the Cobbler happened
to fall sick himself of a serious illness, the Governor of the
town determined to test his skill. For this purpose he called for
a cup, and while filling it with water, pretended to mix poison
with the Cobbler's antidote, commanding him to drink it on
the promise of a reward. The Cobbler, under the fear of death,
confessed that he had no knowledge of medicine, and was only made
famous by the stupid clamors of the crowd. The Governor then
called a public assembly and addressed the citizens: &quot;Of
what folly have you been guilty? You have not hesitated to
entrust your heads to a man, whom no one could employ to make
even the shoes for their feet.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A228">228. The Wolf and the Horse</h3>

<p>A WOLF coming out of a field of oats met a Horse and thus
addressed him: &quot;I would advise you to go into that field. It
is full of fine oats, which I have left untouched for you, as you
are a friend whom I would love to hear enjoying good eating.&quot;
The Horse replied, &quot;If oats had been the food of wolves, you
would never have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly.&quot;

<h3 id="A229">229. The Brother and the Sister</h3>

<p>A FATHER had one son and one daughter, the former remarkable
for his good looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness.
While they were playing one day as children, they happened by
chance to look together into a mirror that was placed on their
mother's chair. The boy congratulated himself on his good
looks; the girl grew angry, and could not bear the self-praises
of her Brother, interpreting all he said (and how could she do
otherwise?) into reflection on herself. She ran off to her father
to be avenged on her Brother, and spitefully accused him of
having, as a boy, made use of that which belonged only to girls.
The father embraced them both, and bestowing his kisses and
affection impartially on each, said, &quot;I wish you both would
look into the mirror every day: you, my son, that you may not
spoil your beauty by evil conduct; and you, my daughter, that you
may make up for your lack of beauty by your virtues.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A230">230. The Wasps, the Partridges, and the Farmer</h3>

<p>THE WASPS and the Partridges, overcome with thirst, came to a
Farmer and besought him to give them some water to drink. They
promised amply to repay him the favor which they asked. The
Partridges declared that they would dig around his vines and make
them produce finer grapes. The Wasps said that they would keep
guard and drive off thieves with their stings. But the Farmer
interrupted them, saying: &quot;I have already two oxen, who,
without making any promises, do all these things. It is surely
better for me to give the water to them than to you.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A231">231. The Crow and Mercury</h3>

<p>A CROW caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him,
making a vow to offer some frankincense at his shrine. But when
rescued from his danger, he forgot his promise. Shortly
afterwards, again caught in a snare, he passed by Apollo and made
the same promise to offer frankincense to Mercury. Mercury soon
appeared and said to him, &quot;O thou most base fellow? how can
I believe thee, who hast disowned and wronged thy former patron?&quot;
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A232">232. The North Wind and the Sun</h3>

<p>THE NORTH WIND and the Sun disputed as to which was the most
powerful, and agreed that he should be declared the victor who
could first strip a wayfaring man of his clothes. The North Wind
first tried his power and blew with all his might, but the keener
his blasts, the closer the Traveler wrapped his cloak around him,
until at last, resigning all hope of victory, the Wind called
upon the Sun to see what he could do. The Sun suddenly shone out
with all his warmth. The Traveler no sooner felt his genial rays
than he took off one garment after another, and at last, fairly
overcome with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in
his path.</p>

<h3 id="A233">233. The Two Men Who Were Enemies</h3>

<p>TWO MEN, deadly enemies to each other, were sailing in the
same vessel. Determined to keep as far apart as possible, the one
seated himself in the stem, and the other in the prow of the ship.
A violent storm arose, and with the vessel in great danger of
sinking, the one in the stern inquired of the pilot which of the
two ends of the ship would go down first. On his replying that he
supposed it would be the prow, the Man said, &quot;Death would
not be grievous to me, if I could only see my Enemy die before me.&quot;
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A234">234. The Gamecocks and the Partridge</h3>

<p>A MAN had two Gamecocks in his poultry-yard. One day by chance
he found a tame Partridge for sale. He purchased it and brought
it home to be reared with his Gamecocks. When the Partridge was
put into the poultry-yard, they struck at it and followed it
about, so that the Partridge became grievously troubled and
supposed that he was thus evilly treated because he was a
stranger. Not long afterwards he saw the Cocks fighting together
and not separating before one had well beaten the other. He then
said to himself, &quot;I shall no longer distress myself at being
struck at by these Gamecocks, when I see that they cannot even
refrain from quarreling with each other.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A235">235. The Quack Frog</h3>

<p>A FROG once upon a time came forth from his home in the marsh
and proclaimed to all the beasts that he was a learned physician,
skilled in the use of drugs and able to heal all diseases. A Fox
asked him, &quot;How can you pretend to prescribe for others,
when you are unable to heal your own lame gait and wrinkled skin?&quot;
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A236">236. The Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox</h3>

<p>A LION, growing old, lay sick in his cave. All the beasts came
to visit their king, except the Fox. The Wolf therefore, thinking
that he had a capital opportunity, accused the Fox to the Lion of
not paying any respect to him who had the rule over them all and
of not coming to visit him. At that very moment the Fox came in
and heard these last words of the Wolf. The Lion roaring out in a
rage against him, the Fox sought an opportunity to defend himself
and said, &quot;And who of all those who have come to you have
benefited you so much as I, who have traveled from place to place
in every direction, and have sought and learnt from the
physicians the means of healing you?&quot; The Lion commanded him
immediately to tell him the cure, when he replied, &quot;You must
flay a wolf alive and wrap his skin yet warm around you.&quot;
The Wolf was at once taken and flayed; whereon the Fox, turning
to him, said with a smile, &quot;You should have moved your
master not to ill, but to good, will.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A237">237. The Dog's House</h3>

<p>IN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as
possible on account of the cold, determined to make himself a
house. However when the summer returned again, he lay asleep
stretched at his full length and appeared to himself to be of a
great size. Now he considered that it would be neither an easy
nor a necessary work to make himself such a house as would
accommodate him.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A238">238. The Wolf and the Lion</h3>

<p>ROAMING BY the mountainside at sundown, a Wolf saw his own
shadow become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to
himself, &quot;Why should I, being of such an immense size and
extending nearly an acre in length, be afraid of the Lion? Ought
I not to be acknowledged as King of all the collected beasts?&quot;
While he was indulging in these proud thoughts, a Lion fell upon
him and killed him. He exclaimed with a too late repentance,
&quot;Wretched me! this overestimation of myself is the cause of
my destruction.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A239">239. The Birds, the Beasts, and the Bat</h3>

<p>THE BIRDS waged war with the Beasts, and each were by turns
the conquerors. A Bat, fearing the uncertain issues of the fight,
always fought on the side which he felt was the strongest. When
peace was proclaimed, his deceitful conduct was apparent to both
combatants. Therefore being condemned by each for his treachery,
he was driven forth from the light of day, and henceforth
concealed himself in dark hiding-places, flying always alone and
at night.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A240">240. The Spendthrift and the Swallow</h3>

<p>A YOUNG MAN, a great spendthrift, had run through all his
patrimony and had but one good cloak left. One day he happened to
see a Swallow, which had appeared before its season, skimming
along a pool and twittering gaily. He supposed that summer had
come, and went and sold his cloak. Not many days later, winter
set in again with renewed frost and cold. When he found the
unfortunate Swallow lifeless on the ground, he said, &quot;Unhappy
bird! what have you done? By thus appearing before the springtime
you have not only killed yourself, but you have wrought my
destruction also.&quot;</p>
