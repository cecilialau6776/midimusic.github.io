<H2>Life of &AElig;sop</H2>
<H3>By George Fyler Townsend</H3>
<P>
THE LIFE and History of &AElig;sop is involved, like that of 
Homer, the most famous of Greek poets, in much obscurity.  
Sardis, the capital of Lydia;  Samos, a Greek island;  Mesembria, 
an ancient colony in Thrace;  and Coti&aelig;um, the chief city of a 
province of Phrygia, contend for the distinction of being the 
birthplace of &AElig;sop.  Although the honor thus claimed cannot be 
definitely assigned to any one of these places, yet there are a few 
incidents now generally accepted by scholars as established facts, 
relating to the birth, life, and death of &AElig;sop.  He is, by an almost 
universal consent, allowed to have been born about the year 620 
B.C., and to have been by birth a slave.  He was owned by two 
masters in succession, both inhabitants of Samos, Xanthus and 
Jadmon, the latter of whom gave him his liberty as a reward for his 
learning and wit.  One of the privileges of a freedman in the ancient 
republics of Greece, was the permission to take an active interest 
in public affairs;  and &AElig;sop, like the philosophers Ph&aelig;do, 
Menippus, and Epictetus, in later times, raised himself from the 
indignity of a servile condition to a position of high renown.  In his 
desire alike to instruct and to be instructed, he traveled through 
many countries, and among others came to Sardis, the capital of 
the famous king of Lydia, the great patron, in that day, of learning 
and of learned men.  He met at the court of Croesus with Solon, 
Thales, and other sages, and is related so to have pleased his 
royal master, by the part he took in the conversations held with 
these philosophers, that he applied to him an expression which 
has since passed into a proverb, &quot;The Phrygian has spoken better 
than all.&quot;
<P>
On the invitation of Croesus he fixed his residence at Sardis, 
and was employed by that monarch in various difficult and delicate 
affairs of State.  In his discharge of these commissions he visited 
the different petty republics of Greece.  At one time he is found in 
Corinth, and at another in Athens, endeavoring, by the narration of 
some of his wise fables, to reconcile the inhabitants of those cities 
to the administration of their respective rulers Periander and 
Pisistratus.  One of these ambassadorial missions, undertaken at 
the command of Croesus, was the occasion of his death.  Having 
been sent to Delphi with a large sum of gold for distribution among 
the citizens, he was so provoked at their covetousness that he 
refused to divide the money, and sent it back to his master.  The 
Delphians, enraged at this treatment, accused him of impiety, and, 
in spite of his sacred character as ambassador, executed him as a 
public criminal.  This cruel death of &AElig;sop was not unavenged.  
The citizens of Delphi were visited with a series of calamities, until 
they made a public reparation of their crime;  and, &quot;The blood of 
&AElig;sop&quot; became a well-known adage, bearing witness to the truth 
that deeds of wrong would not pass unpunished.  Neither did the 
great fabulist lack posthumous honors;  for a statue was erected to 
his memory at Athens, the work of Lysippus, one of the most 
famous of Greek sculptors.  Ph&aelig;drus thus immortalizes the event:
<P class="largerblue">
&AElig;sopo ingentem statuam posuere Attici, Servumque 
collocarunt &aelig;terna in basi:  Patere honoris scirent ut 
cuncti viam;  Nec generi tribui sed virtuti gloriam.
<P>
These few facts are all that can be relied on with any degree 
of certainty, in reference to the birth, life, and death of &AElig;sop.  They 
were first brought to light, after a patient search and diligent 
perusal of ancient authors, by a Frenchman, M. Claude Gaspard 
Bachet de Mezeriac, who declined the honor of being tutor to Louis 
XIII of France, from his desire to devote himself exclusively to 
literature.  He published his Life of &AElig;sop, Anno Domini 1632.  The 
later investigations of a host of English and German scholars have 
added very little to the facts given by M. Mezeriac.  The substantial 
truth of his statements has been confirmed by later criticism and 
inquiry.  It remains to state, that prior to this publication of M. 
Mezeriac, the life of &AElig;sop was from the pen of Maximus Planudes, 
a monk of Constantinople, who was sent on an embassy to Venice 
by the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus the elder, and who wrote in 
the early part of the fourteenth century.  His life was prefixed to all 
the early editions of these fables, and was republished as late as 
1727 by Archdeacon Croxall as the introduction to his edition of 
&AElig;sop.  This life by Planudes contains, however, so small an 
amount of truth, and is so full of absurd pictures of the grotesque 
deformity of &AElig;sop, of wondrous apocryphal stories, of lying 
legends, and gross anachronisms, that it is now universally 
condemned as false, puerile, and inauthentic.** It is given up 
in the present day, by general consent, as unworthy of the slightest 
credit.

**<I> M. Bayle thus characterizes this Life of &AElig;sop by Planudes, &quot;Tous les 
habiles gens conviennent que c'est un roman, et que les absurdites 
grossieres qui l'on y trouve le rendent indigne de toute.&quot;  Dictionnaire 
Historique, Art. Esope.</I>
